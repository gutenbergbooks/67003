<h3 class="p4 h3head ls">PREFACE</h3>

<p class="p2 unindent dropcap">BURTON was a many-sided man. The following
volume of posthumous essays reveals him in
the aspect in which he was best known to the world&mdash;&#8203;as
a traveller and explorer. It will add comparatively
little to the knowledge of the Burton student; to
the general reader it will contain much that is new,
for though Burton wrote and published many bulky
volumes of travel in years gone by, none of them
assumed a popular form, and it may be doubted if
any, save his “Pilgrimage to Meccah and El Medinah,”
reached the outer circle of the great reading public.
Most of his books are now out of copyright, many
are out of print, and few are easily obtainable. This
volume, therefore, will supply a need, in that it gives
in a popular form a consensus of his most important
travels in three continents. It will also, I hope,
remind his countrymen of the achievements of this
remarkable man, and bring home to many a deeper
sense of what we have lost in him. This was the
view taken by Lady Burton, who had hoped to
<!--Page 010-->
incorporate these essays in her memorial edition of
“The Labours and Wisdom of Sir Richard Burton,”
a work cut short by her death. Upon me, therefore,
has devolved the task of editing them and preparing
them for publication. They form the second volume
of the Burton MSS. which have been published since
Lady Burton’s death, and I am the more encouraged
to give them to the world by the success which
attended the previous volume, “The Jew, the Gypsy,
and El Islam.” The reception of this book, though
published under obvious difficulties, and eight years
after the author’s death, showed that the interest in
the great traveller’s work was in no degree abated.</p>

<p>The essays that follow were all prepared by Burton
himself, and most of them were read by him in the
form of lectures before sundry geographical and
scientific societies at different times. For instance,
the description of his expeditions to El Medinah,
Meccah, Harar, and Dahomé were delivered by
him as a course of four lectures before the Emperor
and Empress of Brazil at Rio in 1866. The account
of his Central African expedition was read, I believe,
at Bath, the one on Damascus and Palmyra at
Edinburgh, the one on the Mormons in London. I
have deleted the local and topical allusions, which
arose from the circumstances under which they were
delivered; I have filled in a word or two where
the notes were too sketchy; but that is all.
<!--Page 011-->
Otherwise, the manuscript is reproduced exactly as
it left the author’s hands. In his own words,
simply and unaffectedly, Burton here gives an
epitome of his principal travels in three continents.</p>

<p>In this condensed form the essays necessarily
lose something. On the other hand, they gain much.
Careful and accurate as all Burton’s books of travel
were, his passion for detail sometimes led him into
tediousness. He crammed his notebooks so full
that he had occasionally a difficulty in digesting
the large mass of information he had acquired. He
was addicted to excessive annotation. For instance,
in his book on the Mormons, the large text occupied
on some pages only three lines, the rest of the
page being broken up by closely printed notes,
extracts from Mormon books and sermons, which
can only be considered as superfluous. Extraneous
matter of this kind has been omitted here, and the
result is a clear gain to the narrative.</p>

<p>The book covers the period from 1853 to 1870,
the most active years of Burton’s active life. It
opens most fitly with an account of his pilgrimage
to El Medinah and Meccah. This famous expedition
was the turning-point of Burton’s career; in a sense
it may be said to have been the beginning of it.
Though he had already shown much promise and
some performance, and was known to many in India
as a linguist, soldier, writer, and man of unusual
<!--Page 012-->
ability, he was yet unknown to the greater world
outside. But after his pilgrimage to Meccah his
fame became world-wide and enduring. I say this
in no spirit of exaggeration. When all that Burton
wrote and wrought has passed away into that
limbo of forgetfulness which awaits the labours of
even the most distinguished among us, this at least
will be remembered to his honour, that he was
the first Englishman to penetrate to the Holy of
Holies at Meccah. I write the first Englishman
advisedly. Burckhardt, a Swiss explorer, had gone
part of the way before him, and since his day one
or two have the made the pilgrimage, but, though
it was a sufficiently difficult task when they performed
it, it was much more difficult when Burton did it
in 1853. He was not a man to do things by halves.
He made the pilgrimage thoroughly, living absolutely
the life of the Moslems, wearing their clothes,
eating their food, joining in their prayers, sacrifices,
and ritual, and speaking their language; he did all
this, carrying his life in his hand, for one false step,
one prayer unsaid, one trifling item of the shibboleth
omitted, and the dog of an infidel who had dared
to profane the sanctuary of the Prophet would have
been found out, and his bones would have whitened
the desert sand. Not that Burton went to profane
the tomb of the Prophet. Far from it. From his
early manhood he had been a sympathetic student
<!--Page 013-->
of the higher aspects of El Islam. He had come
to see that in it, above and beyond all the corruptions
and abuses which clung around the Saving Faith, there
existed an occult force which had made it a power
among men. Not only in his achievement, but in
the way he did it, Burton manifested those great
qualities which have made the English race what it is;
he showed tenacity, pluck, and strength of purpose,
and, withal, he accomplished his purpose unobtrusively.
None knew until he came back how great a task
he had achieved.</p>

<p>It was the same with all that Burton undertook.
He did his work thoroughly, and he did it without
any beating of drums or blaring of trumpets. “Deeds,
not words,” was his rule; “Honour, not honours,”
his motto. His expedition to Harar the following
year was almost as arduous as his pilgrimage to
Meccah. No European had ever before passed the
gates of the city in Somaliland. But Burton passed
them, and stayed in Harar some days. Again, his
long and dangerous expedition into Central Africa,
which occupied nearly three years, showed in a
marvellous manner his resource, his courage, and
his powers of endurance. On the unfortunate controversy
which afterwards arose between himself and
Speke it is not necessary to enter here; but this
much, at least, may be said. In the discovery of Lake
Tanganyika Burton was the pioneer; his was the
<!--Page 014-->
brain which planned and commanded the expedition,
and carried it through to a successful issue. It was
he who first achieved with inadequate means and
insufficient escort what Livingstone, Cameron, Speke,
Grant, Baker, and Stanley achieved later.</p>

<p>Of the remaining essays there is little to be said.
Burton’s description of the Mormons in Great Salt
Lake City printed here is, I think, very much better
than his bulky book on the same subject, “The City
of the Saints.” In the larger work Burton ventured
on prophecy, always unsafe, and predicted a great
future for Mormondom and polygamy, a prediction
which has not so far been verified by events. On
the other hand, this account of his mission to Dahomé
certainly loses by excessive condensation. “The Trip
up the Congo” and “The Interior of Brazil”
are lightning sketches of expeditions which involved
much preparation and trouble to carry them through.
“Palmyra” is a formal survey rather than an account
of an expedition. It is interesting, as it marks an
epoch in (one had almost written, the end of) Burton’s
active life. In 1870 he was suddenly recalled from
Damascus by Lord Granville, and his career was
broken.</p>

<p>After his appointment to the post of Consul at
Trieste he went on some expeditions, notably to
Midian, but they were tame indeed compared with
those to Meccah, Harar, and Central Africa. At
<!--Page 015-->
Trieste the eagle’s wings were clipped, and the man
who had great energy and ability, a knowledge of
more than a score of languages, and an unrivalled
experience of Eastern life and literature, was suffered
to drag out eighteen years in the obscurity of a
second-rate seaport town. True, it was not all lost
time, for ample leisure was given him at Trieste for
his literary labours. If he had been thrown in a
more active sphere, his great masterpiece, “Alf
Laylah Wa Laylah” (“The Arabian Nights”) might
never have seen the light.</p>

<p>But when all is said and done, the most fruitful
years of Burton’s career, the richest in promise and
performance, were those that began with the pilgrimage
to Meccah and ended with his recall from
Damascus. They were the very heart of his life:
they are the years covered by this book.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="title">THE VISITATION OF EL MEDINAH</span></h4>

<p class="p2 unindent dropcap">THE Moslem’s pilgrimage is a familiar word to
the Christian’s ear, yet how few are acquainted
with the nature or the signification of the rite!
Unto the present day, learned men&mdash;&#8203;even those who
make a pretence to some knowledge of the East&mdash;&#8203;still
confound Meccah, the birthplace, with El Medinah,
the burial-place, of Mohammed, the Arab law-giver.
“The Prophet’s tomb at Meccah” is a mistake which
even the best-informed of our journals do not disdain
to make.</p>

<p>Before, however, entering upon the journey which
procured for me the title “haji,” it is necessary
for me to dispose of a few preliminaries which must
savour of the personal. The first question that
suggests itself is, “What course of study enabled an
Englishman to pass unsuspected through the Moslem’s
exclusive and jealously guarded Holy Land?”</p>

<p>I must premise that in the matter of assuming an
Oriental nationality, Nature was somewhat propitious
to me. Golden locks and blue eyes, however <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>
desirable, would have been sad obstacles to progress
<!--Page 020-->
in swarthy Arabia. And to what Nature had begun,
art contributed by long years of laborious occupation.</p>

<p>Finding Oxford, with its Greek and Latin, its
mysteries of <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">δε</span> and <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">γαρ</span>, and its theology and mathematics,
exceedingly monotonous, I shipped myself
for India and entered life in the 18th Sepoy Regiment
of the Bombay Presidency. With sundry intervals of
travel, my career between 1843 and 1849 was spent
in Scinde. This newly conquered province was very
Mohammedan, and the conquerors were compelled,
during the work of organisation, to see more of the
conquered than is usual in England’s East Indian
possession. Sir Charles Napier, of gallant memory,
our Governor and Commander-in-Chief, honoured
me with a staff appointment, and humoured my
whim by allowing me to wander about the new land
as a canal engineer employed upon its intricate canal
system. My days and nights were thus spent among
the people, and within five years I was enabled to
pass examinations in six Eastern languages.</p>

<p>In 1849 (March 30th-September 5th) an obstinate
rheumatic ophthalmia, the result of overwork, sent
me back to Europe, where nearly three years were
passed before I was pronounced cured. Then,
thoroughly tired of civilisation and living “dully
sluggardised at home,” and pining for the breath
of the desert and the music of the date-palm, I
volunteered in the autumn of 1852 to explore the great
waste of Eastern and Central Arabia&mdash;&#8203;that huge white
blot which still disgraces our best maps. But the
<!--Page 021-->
Court of Directors of the then Honourable East
India Company, with their mild and amiable chairman,
after deliberation, stoutly refused. They saw in me
only another victim, like Stoddard Connolly and the
brave brothers Wyburd, rushing on his own destruction
and leaving behind him friends and family to trouble
with their requisitions the peace and quiet of the
India House.</p>

<p>What remained to me but to prove that what might
imperil others was to me safe? Supplied with the
sinews of travel by the Royal Geographical Society,
curious to see what men are mostly content to hear
of only&mdash;&#8203;namely, Moslem inner life in a purely
Mohammedan land&mdash;&#8203;and longing to set foot within
the mysterious Meccah which no vacation tourist
had ever yet measured, sketched, photographed, and
described, I resolved, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coûte qu’il coûte</i>, to make the
attempt in my old character of a dervish. The safest
as well as the most interesting time would be during
the pilgrimage season.</p>

<p>The Moslem’s hajj, or pilgrimage, means, I must
premise, “aspiration,” and expresses man’s conviction
that he is but a wayfarer on earth wending towards a
nobler world. This explains the general belief of the
men in sandaled shoon that the greater their hardships,
the sorer to travel the road to Jordan, the higher
will be their reward in heaven. The pilgrim is urged
by the voice of his soul&mdash;&#8203;“O thou, toiling so fiercely
for worldly pleasure and for transitory profit, wilt
thou endure nothing to win a more lasting boon?”
<!--Page 022-->
Hence it is that pilgrimage is common to all ancient
faiths. The Sabæans, or old Arabians, visited the
Pyramids as the sepulchres of Seth and his son
Sabi, the founder of their sect. The classical philosophers
wandered through the Valley of the Nile. The
Jews annually went up to Jerusalem. The Tartar
Buddhists still journey to distant Lamaserais, and
the Hindus to Egypt, to Tibet, to Gaya, on the
Ganges, and to the inhospitable Caucasus. The
spirit of pilgrimage animated mediæval Europe,
and a learned Jesuit traveller considers the processions
of the Roman Catholic Church modern vestiges
of the olden rite.</p>

<p>El Islam&mdash;&#8203;meaning the covenant in virtue of which
men earn eternal life by good works in this world&mdash;&#8203;requires
of all its votaries daily ablution and prayer,
almsgiving on certain occasions, one month’s yearly
fast, and at least one pilgrimage to the House of Allah
at Meccah and the mountain of Ararat. This first,
and often the single, visit is called Hajjat el Islam,
or pilgrimage of being a Moslem, and all those
subsequently performed are regarded as works of
supererogation. The rite, however, is incumbent only
upon those who possess a sufficiency of health or
wealth. El Islam is a creed remarkable for common
sense.</p>

<p>The journey to El Medinah is not called hajj,
but ziyarat, meaning a ceremonial visitation. Thus
the difference between worship due to the Creator
and homage rendered to the creature is steadily placed
<!--Page 023-->
and kept before the Moslem’s eyes. Some sects&mdash;&#8203;the
Wahhabi, or Arabian Puritans, for instance&mdash;&#8203;even condemn
as impious all intercessions between man and
his Maker, especially the prayers at the Prophet’s
grave. The mass, however, of the Mohammedan
Church, if such expression be applicable to a system
which repudiates an ecclesiastical body, considers this
visitation a “practice of the faith, and the most
effectual way of drawing near to Allah through the
Prophet Mohammed.”</p>

<p>The Moslem’s literature has many a thick volume
upon the minutiæ of pilgrimage and visitation. All
four Sumni, or orthodox schools&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, Hunafi, Shafli,
Maliki, and Hanbali&mdash;&#8203;differ in unimportant points
one with the other. Usually pilgrims, especially those
performing the rite for the first time, begin with
Meccah and end with El Medinah. But there is no
positive command on the subject. In these days
pilgrims from the north countries&mdash;&#8203;Egypt and Syria,
Damascus and Bagdad&mdash;&#8203;pass through the Prophet’s
burial-place going to and coming from Meccah, making
a visitation each time. Voyagers from the south&mdash;&#8203;as
East Africa, India, and Java&mdash;&#8203;must often deny themselves,
on account of danger and expense, the spiritual
advantages of prayer at Mohammed’s tomb.</p>

<p>I have often been asked if the pilgrim receives any
written proof that he has performed his pilgrimage.
Formerly the Sherif (descendant of Hasan), or Prince,
of Meccah gave a certificate to those who could
afford it, and early in the present century the names
<!--Page 024-->
of all who paid the fee were registered by a scribe.
All that has passed. But the ceremonies are so complicated
and the localities so peculiar that no book
can thoroughly teach them. The pretended pilgrim
would readily be detected after a short cross-questioning
of the real Simon Pure. As facilities
of travel increase, and the rite becomes more popular,
no pilgrim, unless he comes from the edge of the
Moslem world, cares to bind on the green turban
which his grandfather affected. Few also style themselves
haji, unless for an especial reason&mdash;&#8203;as an
evidence of reformed life, for instance, or a sign of
being a serious person.</p>

<p>Some also have inquired if I was not the first
“Christian” who ever visited the Moslem’s Holy
Land. The learned Gibbon asserted&mdash;&#8203;“Our notions
of Meccah must be drawn from the Arabians. As no
unbeliever is permitted to enter the city, our travellers
are silent.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
But Haji Yunus (Ludovico di Bartema)
performed the pilgrimage in <span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 1503; Joseph Pitts,
of Exeter, in 1680, Ali Bey el Abbasi (the Catalonian
Badia) in 1807, Haji Mohammed (Giovanni Finati,
of Ferrara) in 1811, and the excellent Swiss traveller
Burckhardt in 1814, all passed safely through the
Hejaz, or Holy Land. I mention those only who
have written upon the subject. Those who have
not must be far more numerous. In fact, any man
may become a haji by prefacing his pilgrimage with a
solemn and public profession of faith before the Kazi in
<!--Page 025-->
Cairo or Damascus; or, simpler still, by applying through
his Consulate to be put under the protection of the
Amir el Haji, or Commander of the Pilgrim Caravan.</p>

<p>If I did anything new, it was this&mdash;&#8203;my pilgrimage
was performed as by one of the people. El Islam
theoretically encourages, but practically despises and
distrusts, the burma, or renegade. Such a convert
is allowed to see as little as possible, and is ever
suspected of being a spy. He is carefully watched
night and day, and in troublous times he finds it
difficult to travel between Meccah and El Medinah.
Far be it from me to disparage the labours of my predecessors.
But Bartema travelled as a Mameluke in the
days when Mamelukes were Christian slaves, Pitts was
a captive carried to the pilgrimage by his Algerine
master, Badia’s political position was known to
all the authorities, Finati was an Albanian soldier,
and Burckhardt revealed himself to the old Pacha
Mohammed Ali.</p>

<p>As regards the danger of pilgrimage in the case
of the non-Moslem, little beyond the somewhat
extensive chapter of accidents is to be apprehended
by one conversant with Moslem prayers and formulæ,
manners and customs, and who possesses a sufficient
guarantee of orthodoxy. It is, however, absolutely
indispensable to be a Mohammedan in externals.
Neither the Koran nor the Sultan enjoins the killing
of Hebrew or Christian intruders; nevertheless, in
1860, a Jew, who refused to repeat the Creed, was
crucified by the Meccan populace, and in the event
<!--Page 026-->
of a pilgrim declaring himself to be an infidel the
authorities would be powerless to protect him.</p>

<p>The question of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cui bono?</i>&mdash;&#8203;of what good I did to
others or to myself by the adventure&mdash;&#8203;is not so easily
answered. My account of El Medinah is somewhat
fuller than that of Burckhardt, whose health was
breaking when he visited it. And our caravan’s
route between the Holy Cities was not the beaten
track along the Red Sea, but the little-known eastern
or desert road. Some critics certainly twitted me
with having “turned Turk”; one might turn worse
things. For the rest, man is ever most tempted by
the useless and the impossible.</p>

<p>To appear in character upon the scene of action
many precautions were necessary. Egypt in those
days was a land of passports and policemen; the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute-police</i> was not inferior to that of any European
country. By the advice of a brother-officer, Captain
Grindley, I assumed the Eastern dress at my lodgings
in London, and my friend accompanied me as interpreter
to Southampton. On April 4th, 1853, a
certain Shaykh Abdullah (to wit, myself) left home in
the P. &amp; O. Company’s steamer <span class="title">Bengal</span>, and before
the end of the fortnight landed at Alexandria. It was
not exactly pleasant for the said personage to speak
broken English the whole way, and rigorously to
refuse himself the pleasure of addressing the other
sex; but under the circumstances it was necessary.</p>

<p>Fortunately, on board the <span class="title">Bengal</span> was John Larking,
a well-known Alexandrian. He was in my secret,
<!--Page 027-->
and I was received in his house, where he gave me a
little detached pavilion and treated me as a munshi, or
language-master. My profession among the people
was that of a doctor. The Egyptians are a medico-ridden
race; all are more or less unhealthy, and they
could not look upon my phials and pill-boxes without
yearning for their contents. An Indian doctor was
a novelty to them; Franks they despised; but how
resist a man who had come so far, from east and
west? Men, women, and children besieged my door,
by which means I could see the people face to face,
especially that portion of which Europeans as a rule
know only the worst. Even learned Alexandrians,
after witnessing some of my experiments in mesmerism
and the magic mirror, opined that the stranger was a
manner of holy man gifted with preternatural powers.
An old man sent to offer me his daughter in marriage&mdash;&#8203;my
sanctity compelled me to decline the honour&mdash;&#8203;and
a middle-aged lady offered me a hundred piastres
(nearly one pound sterling) to stay at Alexandria
and superintend the restoration of her blind left eye.</p>

<p>After a month pleasantly spent in the little garden
of roses, jasmine, and oleanders, I made in early June
a move towards Cairo. The first thing was to procure
a passport; I had neglected, through ignorance, to
bring one from England. It was not without difficulty,
involving much unclean dressing and expenditure
of horrible English, that I obtained from H.B.M.’s
Consul at Alexandria a certificate declaring me to be
an Indo-British subject named Abdullah, by profession
<!--Page 028-->
a doctor, and, to judge from frequent blanks in the
document, not distinguished by any remarkable conformation
of eyes, nose, or cheek. This paper, duly
countersigned by the zabit, or police magistrate, would
carry me anywhere within the Egyptian frontier.</p>

<p>At Alexandria also I provided a few necessaries for
the pilgrimage: item&mdash;&#8203;a change or two of clothing; a
substantial leather money belt to carry my gold in; a
little cotton bag for silver and small change, kept ready
for use in the breast pocket; a zemzimiyah, or water-bag
of goatskin; a huge cotton umbrella of Cairene
make, brightly yellow, like an overgrown marigold;
a coarse Persian rug, which acted as bed, table, chair,
and oratory; a pea-green box, with red and yellow
flowers, capable of standing falls from a camel twice
a day, and therefore well fitted for a medicine chest;
and, lastly, the only peculiar article&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the shroud,
without which no one sets out <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to Meccah.
This <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento mori</i> is a piece of cotton six feet long by
five broad. It is useful, for instance, when a man is
dangerously sick or wounded; the caravan, of course,
cannot wait, and to loiter behind is destruction. The
patient, therefore, is ceremonially washed, wrapped up
in his kafan, partly covered with sand, and left to
his fate. It is hard to think of such an end without
horror; the torturing thirst of a wound, the sun
heating the brain to madness, and, worst of all&mdash;&#8203;for
they do not wait for death&mdash;&#8203;the attacks of the jackal,
the vulture, and the ravens of the wilds. This shroud
was duly sprinkled, as is the custom, with the holy water
<!--Page 029-->
of the Zemzem well at Meccah. It later came to a
bad end amongst the villainous Somal in Eastern Africa.</p>

<p>Equipped in a dervish’s frock, I took leave of my
kind host and set out, a third-class passenger, upon
a steamer facetiously known as the <span class="title">Little Asthmatic</span>.
In those days the rail had not invaded Egypt. We
had an unpleasant journey up the Mahmadiyah Canal
and the Nile, which is connected by it with Alexandria.
The usual time was thirty hours. We took three
mortal days and nights. We were nearly wrecked
at the then unfinished Barage, we saw nothing of the
Pyramids but their tops, and it was with a real feeling
of satisfaction that we moored alongside of the old
tumble-down suburb, Bulak.</p>

<p>My dervishhood was perfectly successful. I happened
by chance to touch the elbow of an Anglo-Indian officer,
and he publicly and forcibly condemned my organs of
vision. And I made an acquaintance and a friend on
board. The former was a shawl and cotton merchant,
Meyan Khudabaksh Namdar, of Lahore, who, as the
caravanserais were full of pilgrims, lodged me at his
house for a fortnight. The conversations that passed
between us were published two years later in 1855.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
They clearly pointed to the mutiny which occurred two
years afterwards, and this, together with my frankness
about the Suez Canal,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> did not tend to make me a
favourite with the then effete Government of India.</p>

<p>My friend was a Turkish trader, named Haji
<!--Page 030-->
Wali-el-din. He was then a man about forty-five, of
middle stature, with a large round head closely shaven,
a bull neck, limbs sturdy as a Saxon’s, a thin red beard,
and handsome features beaming benevolence. A
curious dry humour he had, delighting in “quizzing,”
but in so quiet, quaint, and solemn a way that before
you knew him you could scarce divine his drift. He
presently found for me rooms next his own at the
wakalah, or caravanserai, called Jemeliyah, in the Greek
quarter, and I tried to repay his kindness by counselling
him in an unpleasant Consular suit.</p>

<p>When we lived under the same roof, the haji and
I became inseparable. We walked together and dined
together, and spent the evening at a mosque or other
place of public pastime. Sometimes we sat among
the dervishes; but they are a dangerous race, travelled
and inquisitive. Meanwhile I continued to practise my
profession&mdash;&#8203;the medical&mdash;&#8203;and devoted myself several
hours a day to study in the Azhar Mosque, sitting
under the learned Shaykh Mohammed Ali Attar. The
better to study the “humours,” I also became a
grocer and druggist, and my little shop, a mere hole
in the wall, was a perfect gem of Nilotic groceries.
But although I sold my wares under cost price to fair
customers, my chief clients were small boys and girls,
who came, halfpence in hand, to buy sugar and pepper;
so one day, determining to sink the thirty shillings
which my stock in trade had stood me, I locked the
wooden shutter that defended my establishment and
made it over to my shaykh.</p>

<p><!--Page 031-->
The haji and I fasted together during the month
of Ramazan. That year it fell in the torrid June,
and it always makes the Moslem unhealthy and unamiable.
At the end preparations were to be made for
departure Meccah-wards, and the event was hastened
by a convivial <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</i> with a bacchanalian captain
of Albanians, which made the gossips of the quarter
wonder what manner of an Indian doctor had got
amongst them.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough, however, to hire the services
of Shaykh Nur, a quiet East Indian, whose black skin
made society suppose him to be my slave. Never
suspecting my nationality till after my return from
Meccah, he behaved honestly enough; but when
absolved by pilgrimage from his past sins, Haji Nur
began to rob me so boldly that we were compelled
to part. I also made acquaintance with certain sons
of the Holy Cities&mdash;&#8203;seven men from El Medinah and
Meccah&mdash;&#8203;who, after a begging-trip to Constantinople,
were returning to their homes. Having doctored
them and lent them some trifling sums, I was invited
by Shaykh Hamid El Shamman to stay with him at
El Medinah, and by the boy Mohammed El Basyuni
to lodge at his mother’s house in Meccah.</p>

<p>They enabled me to collect proper stores for the
journey. These consisted of tea, coffee, loaf sugar,
biscuits, oil, vinegar, tobacco, lanterns, cooking-pots,
and a small bell-shaped tent costing twelve shillings.
The provisions were placed in a kafas, or hamper,
of palm sticks, my drugs and dress in a sahharah,
<!--Page 032-->
or wooden box measuring some three and a half feet
each way, covered with cowskin, and the lid fitting
into the top. And finally, not wishing to travel by
the vans then allotted to the overland passengers, I
hired two dromedaries and their attendant Bedouins,
who for the sum of ten shillings each agreed to
carry me across the desert between Cairo and Suez.</p>

<p>At last, after abundant trouble, all was ready. At
3 p.m., July 1st, 1853, my friend Haji Wali embraced
me heartily, and so did my poor old shaykh, who,
despite his decrepitude and my objections, insisted
upon accompanying me to the city gate. I will not
deny having felt a tightening of the heart as their
honest faces and forms faded in the distance. All
the bystanders ejaculated, “Allah bless thee, Y’all
Hajj (O pilgrim!), and restore thee to thy family
and thy friends.”</p>

<p>We rode hard over the stretch of rock and hard
clay which has since yielded to that monumental
work, the Suez Canal. There was no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> upon
the road: to the traveller there was an interest in
the wilderness&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p class="center small">Where love is liberty and Nature law&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p class="unindent">unknown to Cape seas and Alpine glaciers and even
the boundless prairie. I felt as if looking once more
upon the face of a friend, and my two Bedouins&mdash;&#8203;though
the old traveller described their forefathers
as “folke full of all evylle condiciouns”&mdash;&#8203;were
excellent company. At midnight we halted for a little
<!--Page 033-->
rest near the Central Station, and after dark on the
next evening I passed through the tumble-down gateway
of Suez and found a shelter in the Wakalah Tirjis&mdash;&#8203;the
George Inn. My Meccan and Medinah friends
were already installed there, and the boy Mohammed
El Basyuni had joined me on the road.</p>

<p>It was not so easy to embark at Suez. In those
days the greater body of pilgrims marched round the
head of the Red Sea. Steamers were rare, and in the
spirit of protection the Bey, or Governor, had orders
to obstruct us till near the end of the season. Most
Egyptian high officials sent their boats laden with
pious passengers up the Nile, whence they returned
freighted with corn. They naturally did their best
to force upon us the delays and discomforts of what
is called the Kussayr (Cosseir) line. And as those
who travelled by the land route spent their money
fifteen days longer in Egyptian territory than they
would have done if allowed to embark at Suez, the
Bey assisted them in the former and obstructed them
in the latter case.</p>

<p>We were delayed in the George Inn four mortal days
and nights amidst all the plagues of Egypt. At last
we found a sambuk, or small-decked vessel, about to
start, and for seven dollars each we took places upon the
poop, the only possible part in the dreadful summer
months. The <span class="title">Silk El Zahab</span>, or <span class="title">Golden Thread</span>,
was probably a lineal descendant from the ships of
Solomon harboured in Ezion Geber. It was about
fifty tons burden, and we found ninety-seven, instead
<!--Page 034-->
of sixty, the proper number of passengers. The farce
of a quarter-deck ten feet by eight accommodated
eighteen of us, and our companions were Magribis,
men from North-Western Africa&mdash;&#8203;the most quarrelsome
and vicious of pilgrims.</p>

<p><a name="fight" id="fight"></a>We sailed on July 6th, and, as in an Irish packet
of the olden time, the first preliminary to “shaking
down” was a general fight. The rais (captain)
naturally landed and left us to settle the matter,
which ended in many a head being broken. I played
my poor part in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> by pushing down a heavy
jar of water upon the swarm of assailants. At last
the Magribis, failing to dislodge us from the poop,
made peace, and finding we were sons of the Holy
Cities, became as civil as their unkindly natures
permitted. We spent twelve days, instead of the
normal five, in beating down the five hundred and
fifty direct miles between Suez and Yambu.</p>

<p>Every second day we managed to land and stretch
our limbs. The mornings and evenings were mild
and balmy, whilst the days were terrible. We felt as
if a few more degrees of heat would be fatal to us.
The celebrated coral reefs of the Red Sea, whence
some authors derive its name, appeared like meadows
of brilliant flowers resembling those of earth, only
far brighter and more beautiful. The sunsets were
magnificent; the zodiacal light, or after-glow, was
a study; and the cold rays of the moon, falling upon
a wilderness of white clay and pinnacle, suggested
a wintry day in England.</p>

<!--Page 036--><!--Blank Page-->

<!--Page 037-->
<p>At last, after slowly working up a narrow creek
leading to the Yambu harbour, on July 17th we
sprang into a shore-boat, and felt new life when
bidding eternal adieu and “sweet bad luck” to the
<span class="title">Golden Thread</span>, which seemed determined to wreck
itself about once per diem.</p>

<p>Yambu, the port of El Medinah, lies S.S.W. of,
and a little over a hundred and thirty miles from,
its city. The road was infamous&mdash;&#8203;rocky, often
waterless, alternately fiery and freezing, and infested
with the Beni Harb, a villainous tribe of hill Bedouins.
Their chief was one Saad, a brigand of the first
water. He was described as a little brown man, contemptible
in appearance but remarkable for courage and
for a ready wit, which saved him from the poison and
pistol of his enemies. Some called him the friend of
the poor, and all knew him to be the foe of the rich.</p>

<p>There was nothing to see at Yambu, where,
however, we enjoyed the hammam and the drinking-water,
which appeared deliciously sweet after the
briny supplies of Suez. By dint of abundant bargaining
we hired camels at the moderate rate of
three dollars each&mdash;&#8203;half in ready money, the rest
to be paid after arrival. I also bought a shugduf,
or rude litter carrying two, and I chose the boy
Mohammed as my companion. The journey is
usually done in five days. We took eight, and we
considered ourselves lucky fellows.</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day (July 18th) we set
out with all the gravity of men putting our heads
<!--Page 038-->
into the lion’s jaws. The moon rose fair and clear
as we emerged from the shadowy streets. When we
launched into the desert, the sweet, crisp air delightfully
contrasted with the close, offensive atmosphere
of the town.</p>

<p>My companions all, as Arabs will do on such
occasions, forgot to think of their precious boxes
full of the plunder of Constantinople, and began
to sing. We travelled till three o’clock in the morning
(these people insist upon setting out in the afternoon
and passing the night in travelling). And the Prophet
informs us that the “calamities of earth,” meaning
scorpions, serpents, and wild beasts, are least dangerous
during the dark hours.</p>

<p>After a pleasant sleep in the wilderness, we joined
for the next day’s march a caravan of grain carriers,
about two hundred camels escorted by seven Turkish
Bashi Buzuk, or Irregular Cavalry. They confirmed
the report that the Bedouins were “out,” and declared
that Saad, the Old Man of the Mountain, had
threatened to cut every throat venturing into his
passes. That night the robbers gave us a mild taste
of their quality, but soon ran away. The third march
lay over an iron land and under a sky of brass to a
long straggling village called, from its ruddy look, El
Hamra (the Red); it is the middle station between
Yambu and El Medinah. The fourth stage placed
us on the Sultan’s high-road leading from Meccah
to the Prophet’s burial-place, and we joined a company
of pious persons bound on visitation.</p>
<!--Page 039-->

<p>The Bedouins, hearing that we had an escort of
two hundred troopers, manned a gorge and would not
let us advance till the armed men retired. The fifth
and sixth days were forced halts at a vile place called
Bir Abbas, where we could hear the distant dropping
of the musketry, a sign that the troops and the hill-men
were settling some little dispute. Again my
companions were in cold perspirations about their
treasures, and passed the most of their time in
sulking and quarrelling.</p>

<p>About sunset on July 23rd, three or four caravans
assembled at Bir Abbas, forming one large body for
better defence against the dreaded Bedouins. We
set out at 11 p.m., travelling without halting through
the night, and at early dawn we found ourselves in
an ill-famed narrow known as Shuab El Haji, or the
Pilgrim’s Pass. The boldest looked apprehensive as
we approached it. Presently, from the precipitous
cliff on our left, thin puffs of blue smoke rose in the
sultry morning air, and afterwards the sharp cracks
of the hill-men’s matchlocks were echoed by the rocks
on the right. A number of Bedouins could be seen
swarming like hornets up the steeper slopes, carrying
huge weapons and “spoiling for a fight.” They took
up comfortable positions on the cut-throat <a name="TN1a" id="TN1a"></a><a href="#TN1">embankment</a>
and began practising upon us from behind their
breastworks of piled stones with perfect convenience
to themselves. We had nothing to do but to blaze
away as much powder and to veil ourselves in as dense
a smoke as possible. The result was that we lost
<!--Page 040-->
twelve men, besides camels and other beasts of burden.
My companions seemed to consider this questionable
affair a most gallant exploit.</p>

<p>The next night (July 24th) was severe. The path
lay up rocky hill and down stony vale. A tripping
and stumbling dromedary had been substituted for
my better animal, and the consequences may be
imagined.</p>

<p>The sun had nearly risen before I shook off the
lethargic effects of such a march. All around me
were hurrying their beasts, regardless of rough
ground, and not a soul spoke a word to his neighbour.
“Are there robbers in sight?” was the natural
question. “No,” responded the boy Mohammed.
“They are walking with their eyes; they will presently
sight their homes.”</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards we came to a huge mudarrij,
or flight of steps, roughly cut in a line of black
scoriaceous basalt. Arrived at the top, we passed
through a lane of dark lava with steep banks on both
sides, and in a few minutes a full view of the Holy
City suddenly opened upon us. It was like a vision
in “The Arabian Nights.” We halted our camels as
if by word of command. All dismounted, in imitation
of the pious of old, and sat down, jaded and hungry
as we were, to feast our eyes on the “country of
date-trees” which looked so passing fair after the
“salt stony land.” As we looked eastward the
sun rose out of the horizon of blue and pink hill,
the frontier of Nejd staining the spacious plains with
<!--Page 041-->
gold and purple. The site of El Medinah is in the
western edge of the highlands which form the plateau
of Central Arabia. On the left side, or north, was
a tall grim pile of porphyritic rock, the celebrated
Mount Ohod, with a clump of verdure and a dome
or two nestling at its base. Round a whitewashed
fortalice founded upon a rock clustered a walled city,
irregularly oval, with tall minarets enclosing a conspicuous
green dome. To the west and south lay
a large suburb and long lines of brilliant vegetation
piercing the tawny levels. I now understood the full
value of a phrase in the Moslem ritual&mdash;&#8203;“And when
the pilgrim’s eyes shall fall upon the trees of El
Medinah, let him raise his voice and bless the Prophet
with the choicest blessings.”</p>

<p>In all the panorama before us nothing was more
striking, after the desolation through which we had
passed, than the gardens and orchards about the town.
My companions obeyed the command with the most
poetical exclamations, bidding the Prophet “live for
ever whilst the west wind bloweth gently over the
hills of Nejd and the lightning flasheth bright in the
firmament of El Hejaz.”</p>

<p>We then remounted and hurried through the Bab
El Ambari, the gate of the western suburb. Crowded
by relatives and friends, we passed down a broad, dusty
street, pretty well supplied with ruins, into an open
space called Barr El Manakhah, or “place where camels
are made to kneel.” Straight forward a line leads
directly into the Bab El Misri, the Egyptian gate of
<!--Page 042-->
the city. But we turned off to the right, and
after advancing a few yards we found ourselves
at the entrance of our friend Shaykh Hamid’s
house. He had preceded us to prepare for our
reception.</p>

<p>No delay is allowed in the ziyarat, or visitation of
the haram, or holy place, which received the mortal
remains of the Arab Prophet. We were barely allowed
to breakfast, to perform the religious ablution, and to
change our travel-soiled garments. We then mounted
asses, passed through the Egyptian, or western, gate,
and suddenly came upon the mosque. It is choked
up with ignoble buildings, and as we entered the
“Dove of Mercy” I was not impressed by the
spectacle.</p>

<p>The site of the Prophet’s mosque&mdash;&#8203;Masjid el
Nabashi, as it is called&mdash;&#8203;was originally a graveyard
shaded by date-trees. The first walls were of adobe,
or unbaked brick, and the recently felled palm-trunks
were made into pillars for the leaf-thatched roof. The
present building, which is almost four centuries old, is
of cut stone, forming an oblong of four hundred and
twenty feet by three hundred and forty feet. In the
centre is a spacious uncovered area containing the
Garden of Our Lady Fatimah&mdash;&#8203;a railed plot of ground
bearing a lote-tree and a dozen palms. At the
south-east angle of this enclosure, under a wooden
roof with columns, is the Prophet’s Well, whose
water is hard and brackish. Near it meets the City
Academy, where in the cool mornings and evenings
<!--Page 043-->
the young idea is taught to shout rather than to
shoot.</p>

<p>Around the court are four riwaks, or porches, not
unlike the cloisters of a monastery; they are arched
to the front, backed by the wall and supported inside
by pillars of different shape and material varying from
dirty plaster to fine porphyry. When I made my
visitation, the northern porch was being rebuilt; it was
to be called after Abd El Majid, the then reigning
Sultan, and it promised to be the most splendid. The
main colonnade, however, the sanctum containing all
that is venerable in the building, embraces the whole
length of the southern short wall, and is deeper
than the other three by nearly treble the number of
columns. It is also paved with handsome slabs of
white marble and marquetry work, here and there
covered with coarse matting and above this by unclean
carpets, well worn by faithful feet.</p>

<p>To understand the tomb a few preliminary remarks
are necessary. Mohammed, it must be remembered,
died in the eleventh year of his mission and the
sixty-third of his age, corresponding with <span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 623.
He was accustomed to say, “In whatsoever spot a
prophet departs this life, there also should he be
buried.” Accordingly his successor ordered the grave
to be dug in the house of the young widow Ayisha,
who lived close to the original mosque. After her
husband’s burial she occupied an adjoining room
partitioned off from the tomb at which men were
accustomed to pray. Another saying of the Prophet’s
<!--Page 044-->
forbade tombs to be erected in mosques; it therefore
became necessary so to contrive that the revered spot
should be in, and yet not in, the place of worship.</p>

<p>Accordingly they built a detached tower in the
south-eastern corner of the mosque, and called it
the hujrah, or chamber. It is from fifty to fifty-five
feet square, with a passage all round, and it extends
from floor to roof, where it is capped by the green
dome which strikes the eyes on approaching the city.
The external material of the closet, which also serves
to protect the remains from infidels and schismatics,
is metal filagree painted a vivid grey green, relieved
by the brightly gilt or burnished brass-work forming
the long and graceful Arabic characters. On the
south side, for greater honour, the railing is plated
over in parts with silver, and letters of the same
metal are interlaced with it.</p>

<p>Entering by the western Door of Safety, we paced
slowly towards the tomb down a line of wall about
the height of a man, and called the “illustrious fronting.”
The barrier is painted with arabesques and
pierced with small doors. There are two niches richly
worked with various coloured marble, and near them
is a pulpit, a graceful collection of slender columns,
elegant tracery, and inscriptions admirably carved.
Arrived at the western small door in the dwarf wall,
we entered the famous spot called El Ranzah (the
“Garden”), after a saying of Mohammed: “Between
my grave and my pulpit is a garden of the gardens
of Paradise.” On the north and west sides it is
<!--Page 045-->
not divided from the rest of the porch, to the south
rises the dwarf wall, and eastward it is bounded by
the west end of the filagree tower containing the tomb.</p>

<p>The “Garden” is the most elaborate part of the
mosque. It is a space of about eighty feet in length
tawdrily decorated to resemble vegetation: the carpets
are flowered, and the pediments of columns are cased
with bright green tiles, and the shafts are adorned
with gaudy and unnatural growths in arabesques. It
is further disfigured by handsome branched candelabra
of cut crystal, the work, I believe, of an English house.
Its peculiar background, the filagree tower, looks
more picturesque near than at a distance, where it
suggests the idea of a gigantic birdcage. The one
really fine feature of the scene is the light cast by the
window of stained glass in the southern wall. Thus
little can be said in praise of the “Garden” by day.
But at night the eye, dazzled by oil lamps suspended
from the roof, by huge wax candles, and by minor
illuminations, whilst crowds of visitors in the brightest
attire, with the richest and noblest of the citizens, sit in
congregation to hear services, becomes far less critical.</p>

<p>Entering the “Garden” we fronted towards Meccah,
prayed, recited two chapters of the Koran, and gave
alms to the poor in gratitude to Allah for making it
our fate to visit so holy a spot. Then we repaired
to the southern front of the chamber, where there
are three dwarf windows, apertures half a foot square,
and placed at eye’s height from the ground. The
westernmost is supposed to be opposite to the face
<!--Page 046-->
of Mohammed, who lies on the right side, facing, as
is still the Moslem custom, the House of Allah at
Meccah. The central hill is that of Abubaki, the
first Caliph, whose head is just behind the Prophet’s
shoulder. The easternmost window is that of Omar,
the second Caliph, who holds the same position with
respect to Abubaki. In the same chamber, but
decorously divided by a wall from the male tenants,
reposes the Lady Fatimah, Mohammed’s favourite
daughter. Osman, the fourth Caliph, was not buried
after his assassination near his predecessors, but there
is a vacant space for Isa bin Maryam when he shall
return.</p>

<p>We stood opposite these three windows, successively,
beginning with that of the Prophet, recited the blessings,
which we were directed to pronounce “with awe and
fear and love.” The ritual is very complicated, and
the stranger must engage a guide technically called
a muzawwir, or visitation-maker. He is always a
son of the Holy City, and Shaykh Hamid was mine.
Many a piercing eye was upon me: the people
probably supposed that I was an Ajemi or Persian,
and these heretics have often attempted to defile the
tombs of the two Caliphs.</p>

<p>When the prayers were at an end, I was allowed to
look through the Prophet’s window. After straining
my eyes for a time, the oil lamps shedding but a
dim light, I saw a narrow passage leading round the
chamber. The inner wall is variously represented to
be made of stone planking or unbaked bricks. One
<!--Page 047-->
sees nothing but thin coverings, a curtain of handsome
silk and cotton brocade, green, with long white letters
worked into it. Upon the hangings were three inscriptions
in characters of gold, informing readers that
behind there lie Allah’s Prophet and the two first
Caliphs. The exact place of Mohammed’s tomb is,
moreover, distinguished by a large pearl rosary and
a peculiar ornament, the celebrated Kankab el Durri,
or constellation of pearls; it is suspended breast high
to the curtain. This is described to be a “brilliant
star set in diamonds and pearls” placed in the dark
that man’s eye may be able to endure its splendours;
the vulgar believe it to be a “jewel of the jewels
of Paradise.” To me it suggested the round glassy
stoppers used for the humbler sort of decanters, but
then I think the same of the Koh-i-Nur.</p>

<p>I must allude to the vulgar story of Mohammed’s
steel coffin suspended in mid-air between two magnets.
The myth has won a world-wide reputation, yet
Arabia has never heard of it. Travellers explain it
in two ways. Niebuhr supposes it to have risen from
the rude ground-plan drawings sold to strangers, and
mistaken by them for elevations. William Banks
believes that the work popularly described as hanging
unsupported in the mosque of Omar at Jerusalem was
confounded with the Prophet’s tomb at El Medinah
by Christians, who until very lately could not have
seen either of these Moslem shrines.</p>

<p>A book which I published upon the subject of my
pilgrimage gives in detail my reason for believing
<!--Page 048-->
that the site of Mohammed’s sepulture is doubtful as
that of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> They are,
briefly, these four: From the earliest days the shape
of the Prophet’s tomb has never been generally known
in El Islam. The accounts of the grave given by
the learned are discrepant. The guardianship of the
spot was long in the hands of schismatics (the Beni
Husayu). And lastly, I cannot but look upon
the tale of the blinding light which surrounds the
Prophet’s tomb, current for ages past, and still
universally believed upon the authority of attendant
eunuchs who must know its falsehood as a priestly
glory intended to conceal a defect.</p>

<p>To that book also I must refer my readers for a
full description of the minor holy places at El Medinah.
They are about fifty in number, and of these about a
dozen are generally visited. The principal of these
are, first, El Bakia (the Country of the Saints), to the
east of the city; on the last day some seventy thousand,
others say a hundred thousand, holy men with faces
like moons shall arise from it; the second is the
Apostle’s mosque at Kubas, the first temple built in
El Islam; and the third is a visitation to the tomb
of Mohammed’s paternal uncle, Hamzeh, the “Lord
of Martyrs,” who was slain fighting for the faith in
<span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 625.</p>

<p>A few observations concerning the little-known
capital of the Northern Hejaz may not be unacceptable.</p>

<p>Medinah El Nahi (the City of the Prophet) is usually
<!--Page 049-->
called by Moslems, for brevity, El Medinah, or the
City by Excellence. It lies between the twenty-fourth
and twenty-fifth degrees of north latitude, corresponding
therefore with Central Mexico; and being high
raised above the sea, it may be called a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tierra temprada</i>.
My predecessor, Burckhardt, found the water detestable.
I thought it good. The winter is long and rigorous,
hence partly the fair complexion of its inhabitants,
who rival in turbulence and fanaticism their brethren
of Meccah.</p>

<p>El Medinah consists of three parts&mdash;&#8203;a town, a
castle, and a large suburb. The population, when I
visited it, ranged from sixteen thousand to eighteen
thousand souls, whereas Meccah numbered forty-five
thousand, and the garrison consisted of a half-battalion,
or four hundred men. Mohammed’s last
resting-place has some fifteen hundred hearths enclosed
by a wall of granite and basalt in irregular layers
cemented with lime. It is pierced with four gates:
the Syrian, the Gate of Hospitality, the Friday, and
the Egyptian. The two latter are fine massive
buildings, with double towers like the old Norman
portals, but painted with broad bands of red pillars
and other flaring colours. Except the Prophet’s
mosque, there are few public buildings. There are
only four caravanserais, and the markets are long
lines of sheds, thatched with scorched and blackened
palm-leaves. The streets are what they should always
be in torrid lands, dark, deep, narrow, and rarely
paved; they are generally of black earth, well watered
<!--Page 050-->
and trodden to harden. The houses appear well
built for the East, of square stone, flat roofed, double
storied, and enclosing spacious courtyards and small
gardens, where water basins and trees and sheds “cool
the eye,” as Arabs say. Latticed balconies are here
universal, and the windows are mere holes in the
walls provided with broad shutters. The castle has
stronger defences than the town, and inside it a tall
donjon tower bears, proudly enough, the banner of the
Crescent and the Star. Its whitewashed lines of wall
render this fortalice a conspicuous object, and guns
pointing in all directions, especially upon the town,
make it appear a kind of Gibraltar to the Bedouins.</p>

<p>For many reasons strangers become very much
attached to El Medinah and there end their lives.
My servant, Shaykh Nur, opined it to be a very
“heavenly city.” Therefore the mass of the population
is of foreign extraction.</p>

<p>On August 28th arrived the great Damascus caravan,
which sets out from Constantinople bringing the
presents of the Sublime Porte. It is the main stream
which absorbs all the small currents flowing at this
season of general movement from Central Asia towards
the great centre of the Islamitic world, and in 1853
it numbered about seven thousand souls. It was
anxiously expected at El Medinah for several reasons.
In the first place, it brought with it a new curtain for
the Prophet’s chamber, the old one being in a tattered
condition; secondly, it had charge of the annual
stipends and pensions for the citizens; and thirdly,
<!--Page 051-->
many families had members returning under its
escort to their homes. The popular anxiety was
greatly increased by the disordered state of the
country round about, and moreover the great caravan
was a day late. The Russian war had extended its
excitement even into the bowels of Arabia, and
to travel eastward according to my original intention
was impossible.</p>

<p>For a day or two we were doubtful about which
road the caravan would take&mdash;&#8203;the easy coast line or
the difficult and dangerous eastern, or desert, route.
Presently Saad the robber shut his doors against us,
and we were driven perforce to choose the worse.
The distance between El Medinah and Meccah by
the frontier way would be in round numbers two
hundred and fifty (two hundred and forty-eight) miles,
and in the month of September water promised to
be exceedingly scarce and bad.</p>

<p>I lost no time in patching up my water-skins, in
laying in a store of provisions, and in hiring camels.
Masad El Harbi, an old Bedouin, agreed to let me
have two animals for the sum of twenty dollars. My
host warned me against the treachery of the wild men,
with whom it is necessary to eat salt once a day.
Otherwise they may rob the traveller and plead that
the salt is not in their stomachs.</p>

<p>Towards evening time on August 30th, El Medinah
became a scene of exceeding confusion in consequence
of the departure of the pilgrims. About an hour
after sunset all our preparations were concluded. The
<!--Page 052-->
evening was sultry; we therefore dined outside the
house. I was told to repair to the shrine for the
ziyarat el widoa, or the farewell visitation. My
decided objection to this step was that we were all
to part, and where to meet again we knew not. I
therefore prayed a two-prostration prayer, and facing
towards the haram recited the usual supplication.
We sat up till 2 p.m. when, having heard no signal
gun, we lay down to sleep through the hot remnant
of the hours of darkness. Thus was spent my last
night at the City of the Prophet.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="title">THE PILGRIMAGE TO MECCAH</span></h4>

<p><span class="sc">On</span> Wednesday, August 31st, 1853, I embraced my
good host, Shaykh Hamid, who had taken great
trouble to see me perfectly provided for the journey.
Shortly after leaving El Medinah we all halted and
turned to take a last farewell. All the pilgrims
dismounted and gazed long and wistfully at the
venerable minarets and the Prophet’s green dome&mdash;&#8203;spots
upon which their memories would ever dwell
with a fond and yearning interest.</p>

<p>We hurried after the Damascus caravan, and
presently fell into its wake. Our line was called
the Darb el Sharki, or eastern road. It owes its
existence to the piety of Zubaydah Khatun, wife of
the well-known Harun el Rashid. That esteemed
princess dug wells, built tanks, and raised, we are
told, a wall with occasional towers between Bagdad
and Meccah, to guide pilgrims over the shifting
sands. Few vestiges of all this labour remained in
the year of grace 1853.</p>

<p>Striking is the appearance of the caravan as it
draggles its slow length along</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">The golden desert glittering through</div>
<div class="i0">The subtle veil of beams,</div>
</div></div>

<p class="unindent"><!--Page 054-->
as the poet of “Palm-leaves” has it. The sky is
terrible in its pitiless splendours and blinding beauty
while the simoon, or wind of the wild, caresses the
cheek with the flaming breath of a lion. The filmy
spray of sand and the upseething of the atmosphere,
the heat-reek and the dancing of the air upon the
baked surface of the bright yellow soil, blending with
the dazzling blue above, invests the horizon with a
broad band of deep dark green, and blurs the gaunt
figures of the camels, which, at a distance, appear
strings of gigantic birds.</p>

<p>There are evidently eight degrees of pilgrims. The
lowest walk, propped on heavy staves; these are the
itinerant coffee-makers, sherbet sellers, and tobacconists,
country folks driving flocks of sheep and goats with
infinite clamour and gesticulation, negroes from distant
Africa, and crowds of paupers, some approaching the
supreme hour, but therefore yearning the more to
breathe their last in the Holy City. Then come the
humble riders of laden camels, mules, and asses, which
the Bedouin, who clings baboon-like to the hairy back
of his animal, despises, saying:&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Honourable to the rider is the riding of the horse;</div>
<div class="i0">But the mule is a dishonour, and a donkey a disgrace.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Respectable men mount dromedaries, or blood-camels,
known by their small size, their fine limbs,
and their large deer-like eyes: their saddles show
crimson sheep-skins between tall metal pommels, and
these are girthed over fine saddle-bags, whose long
tassels of bright worsted hang almost to the ground.
<!--Page 055-->
Irregular soldiers have picturesquely equipped steeds.
Here and there rides some old Arab shaykh, preceded
by his varlets performing a war-dance, compared
with which the bear’s performance is graceful,
firing their duck-guns in the air, or blowing powder
into the naked legs of those before them, brandishing
their bared swords, leaping frantically with
parti-coloured rags floating in the wind, and tossing
high their long spears. Women, children, and
invalids of the poorer classes sit upon rugs or
carpets spread over the large boxes that form the
camel’s load. Those a little better off use a shibriyah,
or short coat, fastened crosswise. The richer prefer
shugduf panniers with an awning like a miniature
tent. Grandees have led horses and gorgeously painted
takhtrawan&mdash;&#8203;litters like the bangué of Brazil&mdash;&#8203;borne
between camels or mules with scarlet and brass
trappings. The vehicle mainly regulates the pilgrim’s
expenses, which may vary from five pounds to as
many thousands.</p>

<p>I will not describe the marches in detail: they much
resemble those between Yambu and El Medinah. We
nighted at two small villages, El Suwayrkiyah and
El Suyayna, which supplied a few provisions to a
caravan of seven thousand to eight thousand souls.
For the most part it is a haggard land, a country of
wild beasts and wilder men, a region whose very
fountains murmur the warning words, “Drink and
away,” instead of “Rest and be thankful.” In other
places it is a desert peopled only with echoes, an
<!--Page 056-->
abode of death for what little there is to die in it,
a waste where, to use an Arab phrase, “La Siwa
Hu”&mdash;&#8203;“There is none but <span class="sc">He</span>.” Gigantic sand
columns whirl over the plains, the horizon is a sea
of mirage, and everywhere Nature, flayed and scalped,
discovers her skeleton to the gazer’s eye.</p>

<p>We passed over many ridges of rough black basalt,
low plains, and basins white with nitrous salt, acacia
barrens where litters were torn off the camels’ backs by
the strong thorns, and domes and streets of polished
rock. Now we travelled down dry torrent-beds of
extreme irregularity, then we wended our way along
cliffs castellated as if by men’s hand, and boulders
and pillars of coarse-grained granite, sometimes thirty
feet high. Quartz abounded, and the country may
have contained gold, but here the superficial formation
has long since been exhausted. In Arabia, as in the
East Indies, the precious metal still lingers. At Cairo
in 1854 I obtained good results by washing sand
brought from the coast of the Red Sea north of Wijh.
My plan for working was rendered abortive by a
certain dictum, since become a favourite with the
governing powers in England&mdash;&#8203;namely, “Gold is
getting too plentiful.”</p>

<p>Few animals except vultures and ravens meet the
eye. Once, however, we enjoyed a grand spectacle.
It was a large yellow lion, somewhat white about the
points&mdash;&#8203;a sign of age&mdash;&#8203;seated in a statuesque pose
upon a pedestal of precipitous rock by the wayside,
and gazing upon the passing spectacle as if monarch
<!--Page 057-->
of all he surveyed. The caravan respected the wild
beast, and no one molested it. The Bedouin of Arabia
has a curious custom when he happens to fall in with
a lion: he makes a profound salaam, says many complimentary
things, and begs his majesty not to harm
a poor man with a large family. If the brute be not
hungry, the wayfarer is allowed to pass on; the latter,
however, is careful when returning to follow another
path. “The father of roaring,” he remarks, “has
repented of having missed a meal.”</p>

<p>On Friday, September 9th, we encamped at Zaribah,
two marches, or forty-seven miles, from Meccah.
This being the north-eastern limit of the sanctuary,
we exchanged our everyday dress for the pilgrim
garb, which is known as el ihrám, or mortification.
Between the noontide and the afternoon prayers our
heads were shaved, our beards and nails trimmed, and
we were made to bathe. We then put on the attire
which seems to be the obsolete costume of the ancient
Arabs. It consists of two cotton cloths, each six feet
long by three or four feet wide, white, with narrow
red stripes and fringes&mdash;&#8203;in fact, that adopted in the
Turkish baths of London. One of these sheets is
thrown over the back and is gathered at the right side,
the arm being left exposed. The waistcloth extends
like a belt to the knee, and, being tucked in at the
waist, supports itself. The head is bared to the rabid
sun, and the insteps, which must also be left naked,
suffer severely.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, we performed a prayer of two
<!--Page 058-->
prostrations, and recited aloud the peculiar formula
of pilgrimage called Talbiyat. In Arabic it is:</p>

<p>The director of our consciences now bade us be
good pilgrims, avoiding quarrels, abusive language,
light conversation, and all immorality. We must
religiously respect the sanctuary of Meccah by sparing
the trees and avoiding to destroy animal life, excepting,
however, the “five instances,”&mdash;&#8203;a crow, a kite,
a rat, a scorpion, and a biting dog. We must abstain
from washes and perfumes, oils, dyes, and cosmetics; we
must not pare the nails nor shave, pluck or cut the
hair, nor must we tie knots in our garments. We were
forbidden to cover our heads with turban or umbrella,
although allowed to take advantage of the shade, and
ward off the sun with our hands. And for each
infraction of these ordinances we were commanded
to sacrifice a sheep.</p>

<p>The women followed our example. This alone
would disprove the baseless but wide-world calumny
which declares that El Islam recognises no soul in,
and consequently no future for, the opposite sex.
<!--Page 059-->
The Early Fathers of the Christian Church may
have held such tenet, the Mohammedans never.
Pilgrimesses exchange the lisam&mdash;&#8203;that coquettish
fold of thin white muslin which veils, but does not
hide, the mouth&mdash;&#8203;for a hideous mask of split, dried,
and plaited palm-leaves pierced with bull’s-eyes to
admit the light. This ugly mask is worn because
the veil must not touch the features. The rest of
the outer garment is a long sheet of white cotton,
covering the head and falling to the heels. We
could hardly help laughing when these queer ghostly
figures first met our sight, and, to judge from the
shaking of their shoulders, they were as much amused
as we were.</p>

<p>In mid-afternoon we left Zaribah, and presently
it became apparent that although we were forbidden
to take lives of others, others were not prevented
from taking <em>ours</em>. At 5 p.m. we came upon a
wide, dry torrent-bed, down which we were to travel
all night. It was a cut-throat place, with a stony,
precipitous buttress on the right, faced by a grim
and barren slope. Opposite us the way seemed to
be barred by piles of hills, crest rising above crest
in the far blue distance. Day still smiled upon the
upper peaks, but the lower grounds and the road
were already hung with sombre shade.</p>

<p>A damp fell upon our spirits as we neared
this “Valley Perilous.” The voices of the women
and children sank into deep silence, and the
loud “Labbayk!” which the male pilgrims are
<!--Page 060-->
ordered to shout whenever possible, was gradually
stilled.</p>

<p>The cause soon became apparent. A small curl
of blue smoke on the summit of the right-hand
precipice suddenly caught my eye, and, simultaneously
with the echoing crack of the matchlock, a dromedary
in front of me, shot through the heart, rolled on
the sands. The Utajbah, bravest and most lawless
of the brigand tribes of the Moslem’s Holy Land,
were determined to boast that on such and such a
night they stopped the Sultan’s caravan one whole
hour in the pass.</p>

<p>There ensued a scene of terrible confusion. Women
screamed, children cried, and men vociferated, each one
striving with might and main to urge his animal beyond
the place of death. But the road was narrow and
half-choked with rocks and thorny shrubs; the vehicles
and animals were soon jammed into a solid and
immovable mass, whilst at every shot a cold shudder
ran through the huge body. Our guard, the irregular
horsemen, about one thousand in number, pushed
up and down perfectly useless, shouting to and
ordering one another. The Pacha of the soldiers had
his carpet spread near the precipice, and over his pipe
debated with the officers about what should be done.
No one seemed to whisper, “Crown the heights.”</p>

<p>Presently two or three hundred Wahhabis&mdash;&#8203;mountaineers
of Tebel Shammar in North-Eastern Arabia&mdash;&#8203;sprang
from their barebacked camels, with their elf-locks
tossing in the wind, and the flaming matches
<!--Page 061-->
of their guns casting a lurid light over their wild
features. Led by the Sherif Zayd, a brave Meccan
noble, who, happily for us, was present, they swarmed
up the steep, and the robbers, after receiving a few
shots, retired to fire upon our rear.</p>

<p>Our forced halt was now exchanged for a flight,
and it required much tact to guide our camels clear
of danger. Whoever and whatever fell, remained
on the ground; that many were lost became evident
from the boxes and baggage which strewed the
shingles. I had no means of ascertaining our exact
number of killed and wounded; reports were contradictory,
and exaggeration was unanimous. The
robbers were said to be one hundred and fifty in
number. Besides honour and glory, they looked
forward to the loot, and to a feast of dead camel.</p>

<p>We then hurried down the valley in the blackness
of night, between ribbed precipices, dark and angry.
The torch smoke and the night fires formed a canopy
sable above and livid below, with lightning-flashes
from the burning shrubs and grim crowds hurrying
as if pursued by the Angel of Death. The scene
would have suited the theatrical canvas of Doré.</p>

<p>At dawn we issued from the Perilous Pass into
the Wady Laymun, or Valley of Limes. A wondrous
contrast! Nothing can be more soothing to the brain
than the rich green foliage of its pomegranates and
other fruit-trees, and from the base of the southern
hills bursts a babbling stream whose</p>

<p class="center small"><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Chiare fresche e dolci acque</i></p>

<p class="unindent"><!--Page 062-->
flow through the garden, cooling the pure air, and
filling the ear with the most delicious of melodies,
the gladdest sound which nature in these regions
knows.</p>

<p>At noon we bade adieu to the charming valley,
which, since remote times, has been a favourite resort
of the Meccan citizens.</p>

<p>At sunset we recited the prayers suited to the
occasion, straining our eyes, but all in vain, to catch
sight of Meccah. About 1 a.m. I was aroused by a
general excitement around me.</p>

<p>“Meccah! Meccah!” cried some voices. “The
sanctuary, oh, the sanctuary!” exclaimed others, and
all burst into loud “Labbayk!” not infrequently
broken by sobs. With a heartfelt “Alhamdu lillah,”
I looked from my litter and saw under the chandelier
of the Southern Cross the dim outlines of a large
city, a shade darker than the surrounding plain.</p>

<p>A cool east wind met us, showing that it was raining
in the Taif hills, and at times sheet lightning
played around the Prophet’s birthplace&mdash;&#8203;a common
phenomenon, which Moslems regard as the testimony
of Heaven to the sanctity of the spot.</p>

<p>Passing through a deep cutting, we entered the
northern suburb of our destination. Then I made
to the Shamiyah, or Syrian quarter, and finally, at
2 a.m., I found myself at the boy Mohammed’s
house. We arrived on the morning of Sunday,
September 11th, 1853, corresponding with Zu’l
Hijjah 6th, 1269. Thus we had the whole day
<!--Page 063-->
to spend in visiting the haram, and a quiet night
before the opening of the true pilgrim season, which
would begin on the morrow.</p>

<p>The morrow dawned. After a few hours of sleep
and a ceremonial ablution, we donned the pilgrim
garb, and with loud and long “Labbayk!” we hastened
to the Bayt Ullah, or House of Allah, as the great
temple of Meccah is called.</p>

<p>At the bottom of our street was the outer Bab El
Salam, or Gate of Security, looking towards the east,
and held to be, of all the thirty-nine, the most
auspicious entrance for a first visit.</p>

<p>Here we descended several steps, for the level of
the temple has been preserved, whilst the foundations
of the city have been raised by the decay of ages.
We then passed through a shady colonnade divided
into aisles, here four, and in the other sides three,
pillars deep. These cloisters are a forest of columns
upwards of five hundred and fifty in number, and
in shape and material they are as irregular as trees.
The outer arches of the colonnade are ogives, and
every four support a small dome like half an orange,
and white with plaster: some reckon one hundred
and twenty, others one hundred and fifty, and
Meccan superstition declares they cannot be counted.
The rear of the cloisters rests upon an outer wall of
cut stone, finished with pinnacles, or Arab battlements,
and at different points in it rise seven minarets.
These are tall towers much less bulky than ours,
partly in facets, circular, and partly cylindrical, built
<!--Page 064-->
at distinct epochs, and somewhat tawdrily banded
with gaudy colours.</p>

<p>This vast colonnade surrounds a large unroofed
and slightly irregular oblong, which may be compared
with an exaggeration of the Palais Royal, Paris.
This sanded area is six hundred and fifty feet long
by five hundred and twenty-five broad, dotted with
small buildings grouped round a common centre, and
is crossed by eight narrow lines of flagged pavement.
Towards the middle of it, one hundred and fifteen
paces from the northern colonnade and eighty-eight
from the southern, and based upon an irregularly
oval pavement of fine close grey gneiss, or granite,
rises the far-famed Kaabah, or inner temple, its
funereal pall contrasting vividly with the sunlit walls
and the yellow precipices of the city.</p>

<p>Behold it at last, the bourn of long and weary
travel, realising the plans and hopes of many and
many a year! This, then, is the kibbal, or direction,
towards which every Moslem has turned in prayer
since the days of Mohammed, and which for long
ages before the birth of Christianity was reverenced
by the patriarchs of the East.</p>

<p>No wonder that the scene is one of the wildest
excitement! Here are worshippers clinging to the
curtain and sobbing as though their hearts would
break; here some poor wretch with arms thrown
high, so that his beating breast may touch the stone
of the house, appears ready to faint, and there men
prostrate themselves on the pavement, rubbing their
<!--Page 065-->
foreheads against the stones, shedding floods of tears,
and pouring forth frenzied ejaculations. The most
careless, indeed, never contemplate it for the first time
without fear and awe. There is a popular jest against
new-comers that in the presence of the Kaabah they
generally inquire the direction of prayer, although
they have all their lives been praying towards it as
the early Christian fronted Jerusalem.</p>

<p>But we must look more critically at the celebrated
shrine.</p>

<p>The word Kaabah means a cube, a square, a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maison carrée</i>. It is called Bayt Ullah (House of
God) because according to the Koran it is “certainly
the first temple erected for mankind.” It is also
known as the “Bride of Meccah,” probably from the
old custom of typifying the Church Visible by a young
married woman&mdash;&#8203;hence probably its face-veil, its
covering, and its guard of eunuchs. Externally it
is a low tower of fine grey granite laid in horizontal
courses of irregular depth; the stones are tolerably
fitted, and are not cemented. It shows no signs of
decay, and indeed, in its present form, it dates only
from 1627. The shape is rather a trapezoid than
a square, being forty feet long by thirty-five broad
and forty-five high, the flat roof having a cubit of
depression from south-west to north-east, where
a gold or gilt spout discharges the drainage. The
foundation is a marble base two feet high, and presents
a sharp inclined plane.</p>

<p>All the Kaabah except the roof is covered with
<!--Page 066-->
a kiswatu garment. It is a pall-like hanging, the
work of a certain family at Cairo, and annually
renewed. The ground is dully black, and Koranic
verses interwoven into it are shining black. There
is a door curtain of gold thread upon red silk, and
a bright band of similar material, called the face-veil
of the house, two feet broad, runs horizontally round
the Kaabah at two-thirds of its height. This covering
when new is tucked up by ropes from the roof;
when old it is fastened to large metal rings welded
into the basement of the building. When this
peculiar adjunct to the shrine is swollen and moved
by the breeze, pious Moslems believe that angels
are waving their wings over it.</p>

<p>The only entrance to the Kaabah is a narrow door
of aloe wood, in the eastern side. It is now raised
seven feet, and one enters it hoisted up in men’s arms.
In <span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 686, when the whole building took its present
shape, it was level with the external ground. The
Kaabah opens gratis ten or twelve times a year,
when crowds rush in and men lose their lives.
Wealthy pilgrims obtain the favour by paying for it.
Scrupulous Moslems do not willingly enter it, as
they may never afterwards walk about barefooted,
take up fire with their fingers, or tell lies. It is not
every one who can afford such luxuries as slippers,
tongs, and truth. Nothing is simpler than the interior
of the building. The walls are covered with handsome
red damask, flowered over with gold, tucked up
beyond the pilgrim’s reach. The flat roof apparently
<!--Page 067-->
rests upon three posts of carved and ornamented
aloe wood.</p>

<p>Between the three pillars, and about nine feet from
the ground, run metal bars, to which hang lamps,
said to be gold. At the northern corner there is a
dwarf door; it leads into a narrow passage and to
the dwarf staircase by which the servants ascend to
the roof. In the south-eastern corner is a quadrant-shaped
sofa, also of aloe wood, and on it sits the
guardian of the shrine.</p>

<p>The Hajar el Aswad, or black stone, of which
all the world talks, is fixed in the south-eastern
angle outside the house, between four and five feet
from the ground, the more conveniently to be kissed.
It shows a black and slaggy surface, glossy and pitch-like,
worn and polished by myriads of lips; its
diameter is about seven inches, and it appears only
in the central aperture of a gilt or gold dish. The
depth to which it extends into the wall is unknown:
most people say two cubits.</p>

<p>Believers declare, with poetry, if not with reason,
that in the day of Atast, when Allah made covenant
concerning the souls that animate the sons of Adam,
the instrument was placed in a fragment of the lower
heaven, then white as snow, now black by reason of
men’s sins. The rationalistic infidel opines this sacred
corner-stone to be a common aerolite, a remnant of
the stone-worship which considered it the symbol
of power presiding over universal reproduction, and
inserted by Mohammed into the edifice of El Islam.
<!--Page 068-->
This relic has fared ill; it has been stolen and broken,
and has suffered other accidents.</p>

<p>Another remarkable part of the Kaabah is that
between the door and the black stone. It is called
the multazem, or “attached to,” because here the
pilgrim should apply his bosom, weep bitterly, and
beg pardon for his sins. In ancient times, according
to some authors, it was the place for contracting
solemn engagements.</p>

<p>The pavement which surrounds the Kaabah is about
eight inches high, and the inside is marked by an
oval balustrade of some score and a half of slender gilt
metal pillars. Between every two of these cross rods
support oil lamps, with globes of white and green
glasses. Gas is much wanted at Meccah! At the
north end, and separated by a space of about five feet
from the building, is El Hatrim, or the “broken,”
a dwarf semi-circular wall, whose extremities are
on a line with the sides of the Kaabah. In its
concavity are two slabs of a finer stone, which cover
the remains of Ishmael, and of his mother Hagar.
The former, I may be allowed to remark, is regarded
by Moslems as the eldest son and legitimate successor
of Abraham, in opposition to the Jews, who prefer
Isaac, the child of Sarai the free woman. It is an
old dispute and not likely to be soon settled.</p>

<p>Besides the Kaabah, ten minor structures dot the
vast quadrangle. The most important is the massive
covering of the well Zemzem. The word means
“the murmuring,” and here the water gushed from
<!--Page 069-->
the ground where the child Ishmael was shuffling his
feet in the agonies of thirst. The supply is abundant,
but I found it nauseously bitter; its external application,
however, when dashed like a douche over the
pilgrim, causes sins to fall from his soul like dust.</p>

<p>On the south-east, and near the well, are the
Kubbatayn, two domes crowning heavy ugly buildings,
vulgarly painted with red, green, and yellow bands;
one of these domes is used as a library. Directly
opposite the Kaabah door is a short ladder or staircase
of carved wood, which is wheeled up to the entrance
door on the rare occasions when it is opened. North
of it is the inner Bab El Salam, or Gate of Security,
under which the pilgrims pass in their first visit to
the shrine. It is a slightly built and detached arch of
stone, about fifteen feet of space in width and eighteen
in height, somewhat like our meaningless triumphal
arches, which come from no place and go nowhere.
Between this and the Kaabah stands the Makam
Ibraham, or Station of Abraham, a small building
containing the stone which supported the Friend of
Allah when he was building the house. It served for
a scaffold, rising and falling of itself as required,
and it preserved the impressions of Abraham’s feet,
especially of the two big toes. Devout and wealthy
pilgrims fill the cavities with water, which they rub
over their eyes and faces with physical as well as
spiritual refreshment. To the north of it is a fine
white marble pulpit with narrow steps leading to the
preacher’s post, which is supported by a gilt and
<!--Page 070-->
sharply tapering steeple. Lastly, opposite the northern,
the western, and the south-eastern sides of the Kaabah,
stand three ornamental pavilions, with light sloping
roofs resting on slender pillars. From these the
representatives of the three orthodox schools direct
the prayers of their congregations. The Shafli, or
fourth branch, collect between the corner of the well
Zemzem and the Station of Abraham, whilst the
heretical sects lay claim to certain mysterious and
invisible places of reunion.</p>

<p>I must now describe what the pilgrims do.</p>

<p>Entering with the boy Mohammed, who acted as
my mutawwif, or circuit guide, we passed through
the inner Gate of Security, uttering various religious
formulas, and we recited the usual two-prostration
prayer in honour of the mosque at the Shafli place
of worship. We then proceeded to the angle of
the house, in which the black stone is set, and there
recited other prayers before beginning tawaf, or
circumambulation. The place was crowded with
pilgrims, all males&mdash;&#8203;women rarely appear during the
hours of light. Bareheaded and barefooted they
passed the giant pavement, which, smooth as glass
and hot as sun can make it, surrounds the Kaabah,
suggesting the idea of perpetual motion. Meccans
declare that at no time of the day or night is the
place ever wholly deserted.</p>

<p>Circumambulation consists of seven shauts, or
rounds, of the house, to which the left shoulder is
turned, and each noted spot has its peculiar prayers.
<!--Page 071-->
The three first courses are performed at a brisk trot,
like the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas gymnastique</i>. The four latter
are leisurely passed. The origin of this custom is
variously accounted for. The general idea is that
Mohammed directed his followers thus to show
themselves strong and active to the infidels, who had
declared them to have been weakened by the air
of El Medinah.</p>

<p>When I had performed my seven courses I fought
my way through the thin-legged host of Bedouins, and
kissed the black stone, rubbing my hands and forehead
upon it. There were some other unimportant
devotions, which concluded with a douche at the well
Zemzem, and with a general almsgiving. The circumambulation
ceremony is performed several times
in the day, despite the heat. It is positive torture.</p>

<p>The visit to the Kaabah, however, does not entitle
a man to be called haji. The essence of pilgrimage
is to be present at the sermon pronounced by the
preacher on the Holy Hill of Arafat, distant about
twelve miles from, and to the east of, Meccah. This
performed even in a state of insensibility is valid,
and to die by the roadside is martyrdom, saving all
the pains and penalties of the tomb.</p>

<p>The visit, however, must be paid on the 8th, 9th,
and the 10th of the month Zu’l Hijjah (the Lord
of Pilgrimage), the last month of the Arab year. At
this time there is a great throb through the framework
of Moslem society from Gibraltar to Japan, and those
who cannot visit the Holy City content themselves
<!--Page 072-->
with prayers and sacrifices at home. As the Moslem
computation is lunar, the epoch retrocedes through
the seasons in thirty-three years. When I visited
Meccah, the rites began on September 12th and ended
on September 14th, 1853. In 1863 the opening
day was June 8th; the closing, June 10th.</p>

<p>My readers will observe that the modern pilgrimage
ceremonies of the Moslem are evidently a commemoration
of Abraham and his descendants. The
practices of the Father of the Faithful when he issued
from the land of Chaldea seem to have formed a
religious standard in the mind of the Arab law-giver,
who preferred Abraham before all the other prophets,
himself alone excepted.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival at Meccah was the Yaum
El Tarwiyah (the Day of Carrying Water), the first
of the three which compose the pilgrimage season
proper. From the earliest dawn the road was densely
thronged with white-robed votaries, some walking,
others mounted, and all shouting “Labbayk!” with
all their might. As usual the scene was one of
strange contrasts. Turkish dignitaries on fine
horses, Bedouins bestriding swift dromedaries, the
most uninteresting soldiery, and the most conspicuous
beggars. Before nightfall I saw no less than
five exhausted and emaciated devotees give up the
ghost and become “martyrs.”</p>

<p>The first object of interest lies on the right-hand
side of the road. This was a high conical hill, known
in books as Tebel Hora, but now called Tebel Nur,
<!--Page 073-->
or Mountain of Light, because there Mohammed’s
mind was first illuminated. The Cave of Revelation
is still shown. It looks upon a wild scene. Eastward
and southward the vision is limited by abrupt hills.
In the other directions there is a dreary landscape,
with here and there a stunted acacia or a clump of
brushwood growing on rough ground, where stony
glens and valleys of white sand, most of them water-courses
after the rare rains, separate black, grey, and
yellow rocks.</p>

<p>Passing over El Akabah (the Steeps), an important
spot in classical Arab history, we entered Muna,
a hot hollow three or four miles from the barren
valley of Meccah. It is a long, narrow, straggling
village of mud and stone houses, single storied and
double storied, built in the common Arab style.
We were fated to see it again. At noon we passed
Mugdalifah, or the Approacher, known to El Islam
as the Minaret without the Mosque, and thus distinguished
from a neighbouring building, the Mosque
without the Minaret. There is something peculiarly
impressive in the tall, solitary, tower springing from
the desolate valley of gravel. No wonder that the
old Arab conquerors loved to give the high-sounding
name of this oratory to distant points in their
extensive empire!</p>

<p>Here, as we halted for the noon prayer, the Damascus
caravan appeared in all its glory. The mahmal, or
litter, sent by the Sultan to represent his presence,
no longer a framework as on the line of march, now
<!--Page 074-->
flashed in the sun all gold and green, and the huge
white camel seemed to carry it with pride. Around
the moving host of peaceful pilgrims hovered a crowd
of mounted Bedouins armed to the teeth. These
people often visit Arafat for blood revenge; nothing
can be more sacrilegious than murder at such a
season, but they find the enemy unprepared. As
their draperies floated in the wind and their faces
were swathed and veiled with their head-kerchiefs,
it was not always easy to distinguish the sex of the
wild beings who hurried past at speed. The women
were unscrupulous, and many were seen emulating the
men in reckless riding, and in striking with their sticks
at every animal in their way.</p>

<p>Presently, after safely threading the gorge called
the pass of the Two Rugged Hills, and celebrated for
accidents, we passed between the two “signs”&mdash;&#8203;whitewashed
pillars, or, rather, tall towers, their walls
surmounted with pinnacles. They mark the limits of
the Arafat Plain&mdash;&#8203;the Standing-Ground, as it is called.
Here is sight of the Holy Hill of Arafat, standing
boldly out from the fair blue sky, and backed by the
azure peaks of Taif. All the pilgrim host raised loud
shouts of “Labbayk!” The noise was that of a storm.</p>

<p>We then sought our quarters in the town of tents
scattered over two or three miles of plain at the
southern foot of the Holy Hill, and there we passed
a turbulent night of prayer.</p>

<p>I estimated the total number of devotees to be fifty
thousand; usually it may amount to eighty thousand.
<!--Page 075-->
The Arabs, however, believe that the total of those
“standing on Arafat” cannot be counted, and that
if less than six hundred thousand human beings are
gathered, the angels descend and make up the sum.
Even in <span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 1853 my Moslem friends declared that
a hundred and fifty thousand immortal beings were
present in mortal shape.</p>

<p>The Mount of Mercy, which is also called Tebel
Ilál, or Mount of Wrestling in Prayer, is physically
considered a mass of coarse granite, split into large
blocks and thinly covered with a coat of withered
thorns. It rises abruptly to a height of a hundred and
eighty to two hundred feet from the gravelly flat,
and it is separated by a sandy vale from the last
spur of the Taif hills. The dwarf wall encircling it
gives the barren eminence a somewhat artificial look,
which is not diminished by the broad flight of steps
winding up the southern face, and by the large
stuccoed platform near the summit, where the
preacher delivers the “Sermon of the Standing.”</p>

<p>Arafat means “recognition,” and owes its name
and honours to a well-known legend. When our first
parents were expelled from Paradise, which, according
to Moslems, is in the lowest of the seven heavens,
Adam descended at Ceylon, Eve upon Arafat. The
former, seeking his wife, began a journey to which
the earth owes its present mottled appearance.
Wherever he placed his foot a town arose in the
fulness of time; between the strides all has remained
country. Wandering for many years he came to the
<!--Page 076-->
Holy Hill of Arafat, the Mountain of Mercy, where
our common mother was continually calling upon his
name, and their recognition of each other there gave the
place its name. Upon the hill-top, Adam, instructed
by the Archangel Gabriel, erected a prayer-station,
and in its neighbourhood the pair abode until death.</p>

<p>It is interesting to know that Adam’s grave is
shown at Muna, the village through which we had
passed that day. The mosque covering his remains
is called El Kharf; his head is at one end of the long
wall, his feet are at the other, and the dome covers
his middle. Our first father’s forehead, we are told,
originally brushed the skies, but this stature being
found inconvenient, it was dwarfed to a hundred and
fifty feet. Eve, again, is buried near the port of
Meccah&mdash;&#8203;Jeddah, which means the “grandmother.”
She is supposed to lie, like a Moslemah, fronting the
Kaabah, with her head southwards, her feet to the
north, and her right cheek resting on her right hand.
Whitewashed and conspicuous to the voyager from
afar is the dome opening to the west, and covering
a square stone fancifully carved to represent her
middle. Two low parallel walls about eighteen feet
apart define the mortal remains of our mother, who,
as she measured a hundred and twenty paces from
head to waist and eighty from waist to heel, must
have presented in life a very peculiar appearance.
The archæologist will remember that the great idol
of Jeddah in the age of the Arab litholatry was a
“long stone.”</p>

<!--Page 077-->
<p>The next day, the 9th of the month Zu’l Hijjah,
is known as Yaum Arafat (the Day of Arafat). After
ablution and prayer, we visited sundry interesting
places on the Mount of Mercy, and we breakfasted
late and copiously, as we could not eat again before
nightfall. Even at dawn the rocky hill was crowded
with pilgrims, principally Bedouins and wild men, who
had secured favourable places for hearing the discourse.
From noon onwards the hum and murmur of the
multitude waxed louder, people swarmed here and
there, guns fired, and horsemen and camelmen rushed
about in all directions. A discharge of cannon about
2 p.m. announced that the ceremony of wukuf, or
standing on the Holy Hill, was about to commence.</p>

<p>The procession was headed by the retinue of the
Sherif, or Prince, of Meccah, the Pope of El Islam.
A way for him was cleared through the dense mob of
spectators by a cloud of macebearers and by horsemen
of the desert carrying long bamboo spears tufted with
black ostrich feathers. These were followed by led
horses, the proudest blood of Arabia, and by a
stalwart band of negro matchlock men. Five red
and green flags immediately preceded the Prince, who,
habited in plain pilgrim garb, rode a fine mule. The
only sign of his rank was a fine green silk and gold
umbrella, held over his head by one of his slaves. He
was followed by his family and courtiers, and the rear
was brought up by a troop of Bedouins on horses
and dromedaries. The picturesque background of
the scene was the granite hill, covered, wherever foot
<!--Page 078-->
could be planted, with half-naked devotees, crying
“Labbayk!” at the top of their voices, and violently
waving the skirts of their gleaming garments. It
was necessary to stand literally upon Arafat, but we
did not go too near, and a little way off sighted the
preacher sitting, after the manner of Mohammed, on
his camel and delivering the sermon. Slowly the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortège</i> wound its way towards the Mount of Mercy.
Exactly at afternoon prayer-time, the two mahmal,
or ornamental litters, of Damascus and Cairo, took
their station side by side on a platform in the lower
part of the hill. A little above them stood the Prince
of Meccah, within hearing of the priest. The pilgrims
crowded around them. The loud cries were stilled,
and the waving of white robes ceased.</p>

<p>Then the preacher began the “Sermon of the
Mount,” which teaches the devotees the duties of the
season. At first it was spoken without interruption;
then: loud “Amin” and volleys of “Labbayk” exploded
at certain intervals. At last the breeze became
laden with a purgatorial chorus of sobs, cries, and
shrieks. Even the Meccans, who, like the sons of
other Holy Cities, are hardened to holy days, thought
it proper to appear affected, and those unable to
squeeze out a tear buried their faces in the corners
of their pilgrim cloths. I buried mine&mdash;&#8203;at intervals.</p>

<p>The sermon lasted about three hours, and when
sunset was near, the preacher gave the israf, or
permission to depart. Then began that risky part
of the ceremony known as the “hurrying from
<!--Page 079-->
Arafat.” The pilgrims all rushed down the Mount
of Mercy with cries like trumpet blasts, and took the
road to Muna. Every man urged his beast to the
uttermost over the plain, which bristled with pegs,
and was strewn with struck tents. Pedestrians were
trampled, litters were crushed, and camels were thrown;
here a woman, there a child, was lost, whilst night
coming on without twilight added to the chaotic
confusion of the scene. The pass of the Two Rugged
Hills, where all the currents converged, was the
crisis, after which progress was easier. We spent,
however, at least three hours in reaching Mugdalifah,
and there we resolved to sleep. The minaret was
brilliantly illuminated, but my companions apparently
thought more of rest and supper than of prayer.
The night was by no means peaceful nor silent. Lines
of laden beasts passed us every ten minutes, devotees
guarding their boxes from plunderers gave loud
tokens of being wide awake, and the shouting of
travellers continued till near dawn.</p>

<p>The 10th of Zu’l Hijjah, the day following the
sermon, is called Yaum Vahr (the Day of Camel Killing),
or EEd El Kurban (the Festival of the Sacrifice), the
Kurban Bairam of the Turks. It is the most solemn
of the year, and it holds amongst Moslems the rank
which Easter Day claims from Christendom.</p>

<p>We awoke at daybreak, and exchanged with all
around us the compliments of the season&mdash;&#8203;“EEd
Kum mubarak”&mdash;&#8203;“May your festival be auspicious.”
Then each man gathered for himself seven jamrah
<!--Page 080-->
(bits of granite the size of a small bean), washed them
in “seven waters,” and then proceeded to the western
end of the long street which forms the village of
Muna. Here is the place called the Great Devil,
to distinguish it from two others, the Middle Devil
and the First Devil, or the easternmost. The
outward and visible signs are nothing but short
buttresses of whitewashed masonry placed against a
rough wall in the main thoroughfare. Some derive
the rite from the days of Adam, who put to flight
the Evil One by pelting him, as Martin Luther did
with the inkstand. Others opine that the ceremony
is performed in imitation of Abraham, who, meeting
Sathanas at Muna, and being tempted to disobedience
in the matter of sacrificing his son, was commanded
by Allah to drive him away with stones. Pilgrims
approach if possible within five paces of the pillar, and
throw at it successfully seven pebbles, holding each
one between the thumb and forefinger of the right
hand, either extended, or shooting it as a boy does
a marble. At every cast they exclaim: “In the name
of Allah, and Allah is almighty! In hatred to the
Fiend and to his shame I do this!” It is one of
the local miracles that all the pebbles thus flung
return by spiritual agency whence they came.</p>

<p>As Satan was malicious enough to appear in a
rugged lane hardly forty feet broad, the place was
rendered dangerous by the crowd. On one side
stood the devil’s buttress and wall, bristling with
wild men and boys. Opposite it was a row of
<!--Page 081-->
temporary booths tenanted by barbers, and the space
between swarmed with pilgrims, all trying to get
at the enemy of mankind. A monkey might have
run over the heads of the mob. Amongst them
were horsemen flogging their steeds, Bedouins urging
frightened camels, and running footmen opening paths
for the grandees, their masters, by assault and battery.
We congratulated each other, the boy Mohammed
and I, when we escaped with trifling hurts. Some
Moslem travellers assert, by way of miracle, that no
man was ever killed during the ceremony of rajm,
or lapidation. Several Meccans, however, assured
me that fatal accidents are by no means rare.</p>

<p>After throwing the seven pebbles, we doffed
our pilgrim garb, and returned to ihlal, or normal
attire.</p>

<p>The barber placed us upon an earthen bench in
the open shop, shaved our heads, trimmed our beards,
and pared our nails, causing us to repeat after him:
“I purpose throwing off my ceremonial attire, according
to the practice of the Prophet&mdash;&#8203;whom may Allah
bless and preserve! O Allah, grant to me for every
hair a light, a purity, and a generous reward! In
the name of Allah, and Allah is almighty!” The
barber then addressed me: “Naiman”&mdash;&#8203;“Pleasure
to thee!”&mdash;&#8203;and I responded: “Allah, give <em>thee</em>
pleasure!” Now we could at once use cloths to
cover our heads, and slippers to defend our feet from
fiery sun and hot soil, and we might safely twirl our
mustachios and stroke our beards&mdash;&#8203;placid enjoyments
<!--Page 082-->
of which we had been deprived by the ceremonial
law.</p>

<p>The day ended with the sacrifice of an animal to
commemorate the substitution of a ram for Ishmael,
the father of the Arabs. The place of the original
offering is in the Muna Valley, and it is still visited
by pilgrims. None but the Kruma, the Pacha, and
high dignitaries slaughter camels. These beasts are
killed by thrusting a knife into the interval between
the throat and the breast, the muscles of the wind-pipe
being too hard and thick to cut; their flesh is
lawful to the Arabs, but not to the Hebrews. Oxen,
sheep, and goats are made to face the Kaabah, and
their throats are cut, the sacrificer ejaculating: “In
the name of Allah! Allah is almighty!” It is
meritorious to give away the victim without eating
any part of it, and thus crowds of poor pilgrims
were enabled to regale themselves.</p>

<p>There is a terrible want of cleanliness in this
sacrifice. Thousands of animals are cut up and left
unburied in this “Devil’s Punchbowl.” I leave the
rest to the imagination. Pilgrims usually pass in
the Muna Valley the Days of Flesh Drying&mdash;&#8203;namely,
the 11th, the 12th, and the 13th of the month
Zu’l Hijjah&mdash;&#8203;and on the two former the Great,
the Middle, and the Little Satan are again pelted.
The standing miracles of the place are that beasts
and birds cannot prey there, nor can flies settle upon
provisions exposed in the markets. But animals are
frightened away by the bustling crowds, and flies are
<!--Page 083-->
found in myriads. The revolting scene, aided by a
steady temperature of 120° Fahr., has more than once
caused a desolating pestilence at Meccah: the cholera
of 1865 has been traced back to it; in fine, the safety
of Europe demands the reformation of this filthy
slaughter-house, which is still the same.</p>

<p>The pilgrimage rites over, we returned to Meccah
for a short sojourn. Visitors are advised, and wisely,
not to linger long in the Holy City after the conclusion
of the ceremonies. Use soon spoils the
marvels, and, after the greater excitements, all becomes
flat, stale, and unprofitable. The rite called umrah,
or the “little pilgrimage,” and the running between
Mounts Safa and Marwah, in imitation of Hagar
seeking her child, remain to be performed. And
there are many spots of minor sanctity to be visited,
such as the Jannal El Maala, or Cemetery of the Saints,
the mosque where the genii paid fealty to the Prophet,
the house where Mohammed was born, that in which
he lived with his first wife, Khadijah, and in which
his daughter Fatimah and his grandsons Hasan and
Hussayn saw the light, the place where the stone
gave the founder of El Islam God-speed, and about a
dozen others. Men, however, either neglect them
or visit them cursorily, and think of little now beyond
returning home.</p>

<p>I must briefly sketch the Holy City before we bid
it adieu.</p>

<p>Meccah, also called Beccah, the words being
synonymous, signifies according to some a “place
<!--Page 084-->
of great concourse,” is built between 21° and 22° of
N. Lat. and in 39° E. Long. (Greenwich).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> It is
therefore more decidedly tropical than El Medinah,
and the parallel corresponds with that of Cuba. The
origin of the Bayt Ullah is lost in the glooms of
time, but Meccah as it now stands is a comparatively
modern place, built in <span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 450 by Kusayr the
Kuraysh. It is a city colligated together like Jerusalem
and Rome. The site is a winding valley in the midst
of many little hills; the effect is that it offers no
general <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’œil</i>. Thus the views of Meccah known
to Europe are not more like Meccah than like Cairo
or Bombay.</p>

<p>The utmost length of the Holy City is two miles
and a half from the Mab’dah, or northern suburb,
to the southern mound called Jiyad. The extreme
breadth may be three-quarters between the Abu
Kubays hill on the east and the Kaykaan, or
Kuwaykaan, eminence on the west. The mass of
<!--Page 085-->
houses clusters at the western base of Abu Kubays.
The mounts called Safa and Marwah extend from Abu
Kubays to Kayhaan, and are about seven hundred
and eighty cubits apart. The great temple is near
the centre of the city, as the Kaabah is near the
middle of the temple. Upon Jebel Jiyad the Greater
there is a fort held by Turkish soldiery; it seems
to have no great strength. In olden time Meccah
had walls and gates; now there are none.</p>

<p>The ground in and about the Holy City is sandy
and barren, the hills are rocky and desert. Meat,
fruits, and vegetables must be imported <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> Jeddah,
the port, distant about forty-five miles. The climate
is exceedingly hot and rarely tempered by the sea
breeze. I never suffered so much from temperature
as during my fortnight at Meccah.</p>

<p>The capital of the Hejaz, which is about double
the size of El Medinah, has all the conveniences of
a city. The streets are narrow, deep, and well watered.
The houses are durable and well built of brick mixed
with granite and sandstone, quarried in the neighbouring
hills. Some of them are five stories high, and
more like fortresses than dwelling-places. The lime,
however, is bad, and after heavy rain, sometimes ten
days in the year, those of inferior structure fall in
ruins. None but the best have open-work of brick
and courses of coloured stone. The roofs are made
flat to serve for sleeping-places, the interiors are
sombre to keep out the heat; they have jutting upper
stories, as in the old town of Brazil, and huge latticed
<!--Page 086-->
hanging balconies&mdash;&#8203;the maswrabujah of Cairo, here
called the shamiyah&mdash;&#8203;project picturesquely into the
streets and the small squares in which the city abounds.</p>

<p>The population is guessed at forty-five thousand
souls. The citizens appeared to me more civilised
and more vicious than those of El Medinah, and their
habit of travel makes them a worldly-wise and God-forgetting
and Mammonist sort of folk. “Circumambulate
and run between Mounts Safa and
Marwah and do the seven deadly sins,” is a satire
popularly levelled against them. Their redeeming
qualities are courage, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhomie</i>, manners at once
manly and suave, a fiery sense of honour, strong
family affections, and a near approach to what we call
patriotism. The dark half of the picture is pride,
bigotry, irreligion, greed of gain, debauchery, and
prodigal ostentation.</p>

<p>Unlike his brother of El Medinah, the Meccan
is a swarthy man. He is recognised throughout the
east by three parallel gashes down each cheek, from
the exterior angles of the eyes to the corners of the
mouth. These mashali, as they call them, are
clean contrary to the commands of El Islam. The
people excuse the practice by saying that it preserves
their children from being kidnapped, and it is
performed the fortieth day after birth.</p>

<p>The last pilgrimage ceremony performed at Meccah
is the Tawaf el Widaaf, or circumambulation of
farewell, a solemn occasion. The devotee walks
round the House of Allah, he drinks the water of
<!--Page 087-->
the Zemzem well, he kisses the threshold of the door,
and he stands for some time with his face and bosom
pressed against the multazem wall, clinging to the
curtain, reciting religious formulas, blessing the
Prophet, weeping if possible, but at least groaning.
He then leaves the temple, backing out of it with
many salutations till he reaches the Gate of Farewell,
when, with a parting glance at the Kaabah, he turns
his face towards home.</p>

<p>I will not dwell upon my return journey&mdash;&#8203;how,
accompanied by the boy Mohammed, I reached Jeddah
on the Red Sea, how my countrymen refused for a
time to believe me, and how I sadly parted with my
Moslem friends. My wanderings ended for a time,
and, worn out with fatigue and with the fatal fiery
heat, I steamed out of Jeddah on September 26th in
the little <span class="title">Dwarka</span>, and on October 3rd, 1853, after
six months’ absence from England, I found myself
safely anchored in Suez Harbour.</p>

<h4 class="p4 h4head"><span class="title">A RIDE TO HARAR</span></h4>

<p class="p2 unindent dropcap">THE pilgrimage to Meccah being a thing of the
past, and the spirit of unrest still strong within
me, I next turned my thoughts to the hot depths of
the Dark Continent. Returning to Bombay early in
1854, I volunteered to explore the Land of the Somali,
the eastern horn of Africa, extending from Cape
Guardafui (<abbr title="North Latitude">N. Lat.</abbr> 12°) to near the Equator. For
many years naval officers had coasted along it; many
of our ships had been lost there, and we had carefully
shot their wreckers and plunderers. But no modern
traveller had ventured into the wild depths, and we
were driven for information to the pages of Father
Lobo, of Salt, and de Rienzi.</p>

<p>My project aimed at something higher; and indeed
it was this journey which led directly to the discovery
of the sources of the Nile, so far as they are yet
discovered.</p>

<p>I had read in Ptolemy (<abbr title="One, paragraph">I., par.</abbr> 9) the following
words: “Then concerning the navigation between
the Aromata Promontory (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, Guardafui) and Rhapta
(the ‘place of seven ships,’ generally supposed to be
north of Kilwa), Marianus of Tyre declares that a
certain Diogenes, one of those sailing to India …
<!--Page 092-->
when near Aromata and having the Troglodytic region
on the right (some of the Somali were still cave-dwellers),
reached, after twenty-five days’ march, the lakes (plural
and not dual) whence the Nile flows and of which
Point Raphta is a little south.”</p>

<p>This remarkable passage was to me a revelation; it
was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot de l’enigme</i>, the way to make the egg
stand upright, the rending of the veil of Isis. The
feat for which Julius Cæsar would have relinquished
a civil war, the secret which kings from Nero to
Mahommet Ali vainly attempted to solve, the
discovery of which travellers, from Herodotus to
Bruce, have risked their lives, was reduced to comparative
facility. For the last three thousand years
explorers had been working, literally and metaphorically,
against the stream, where disease and savagery had
exhausted health and strength, pocket and patience, at
the very beginning of the end. I therefore resolved
to reverse the operation, and thus I hoped to see the
young Nile and to stultify a certain old proverb.</p>

<p>The Court of Directors of the Honourable East
India Company unwillingly sanctioned my project: I
was too clever by half, and they suspected that it
concealed projects of annexation or conquest. All
that my political views aimed at was to secure the
supremacy of my country in the Red Sea. Despite
Lord Palmerston and Robert Stephenson, I foresaw
that the Suez Canal would be a success, and I proposed
to purchase for the sum of £10,000 all the ports
on the East African shore as far south as Berbera.
<!--Page 093-->
This was refused; I was sternly reprimanded, and
the result will presently appear.</p>

<p>In July of the same year we reached Aden from
Bombay. Our little party was composed of Lieutenant
Herne and Lieutenant Stroyan, with myself in command.
Before setting out I permitted Lieutenant
J. H. Speke to join us; he was in search of African
sport, and, being a stranger, he was glad to find
companions. This officer afterwards accompanied me
to Central Africa, and died at Bath on Thursday,
September 15th, 1864.</p>

<p>Aden&mdash;&#8203;“eye of Yemen,” the “coal-hole of the
East” (as we call it), the “dry and squalid city”
of Abulfeda&mdash;&#8203;gave me much trouble. It is one of
the worst, if not <em>the</em> worst, places of residence to
which Anglo-Indians can be condemned. The town
occupies the crater floor of an extinct volcano whose
northern wall, a grim rock of bare black basalt known
as Jebel Shamsham, is said to be the sepulchre of
Kabil, or Cain, and certainly the First Murderer lies
in an appropriate spot. Between May and October
the climate is dreadful. The storms of unclean dust
necessitate candles at noon, and not a drop of rain
falls, whilst high in the red hot air you see the clouds
rolling towards the highlands of the interior, where
their blessed loads will make Arabia happy. In
Yemen&mdash;&#8203;Arabia Felix&mdash;&#8203;there are bubbling springs
and fruits and vineyards, sweet waters, fertilising suns,
and cool nights. In Aden and its neighbourhood all
is the abomination of desolation.</p>

<!--Page 094-->
<p>The miseries of our unfortunate troops might have
been lightened had we originally occupied the true
key of the Red Sea, the port of Berbera on the
Somali coast opposite Aden. But the step had been
taken; the authorities would not say “Peccavi” and
undo the past. Therefore we died of fever and
dysentery; the smallest wound became a fearful
ulcer which destroyed limb or life. Even in health,
existence without appetite or sleep was a pest. I
had the audacity to publish these facts, and had once
more to pay the usual penalty for telling the truth.</p>

<p>The English spirit suffers from confinement behind
any but wooden walls, and the Aden garrison displayed
a timidity which astonished me. The fierce faces,
the screaming voices, and the frequent faction fights
of the savage Somali had cowed our countrymen, and
they were depressed by a “peace at any price” policy.
Even the Brigadier commanding, General (afterwards
Sir) James Outram, opposed my explorations, and the
leader was represented as a madman leading others to
a certain and cruel death.</p>

<p>I at once changed my plans. To prove that the
journey presented no real danger, I offered to visit
alone what was considered the most perilous part
of the country and explore Harar, the capital of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra incognita</i>. But to prevent my being
detained meanwhile, I stationed my companions on
the African coast with orders to seize and stop
the inland caravans&mdash;&#8203;a measure which would have
had the effect of releasing me. This is a serious
<!--Page 095-->
danger in Abyssinian travel: witness the case of
Pedro Cavilham in 1499, and the unfortunate Consul
Cameron in our own day. Those “nameless
Ethiopians,” the older savages, sacrificed strangers to
their gods. The modern only keep them in irons,
flog them, and starve them.</p>

<p>At the time I went few but professed geographers
knew even the name of Harar, or suspected that within
three hundred miles of Aden there is a counterpart
of ill-famed Timbuctu. Travellers of all nations had
attempted it in vain; men of science, missionaries,
and geographers had all failed. It was said that some
Hamitu prophet had read decline and fall in the first
footsteps of the Frank, and that the bigoted barbarians
had threatened death to the infidel caught within
their walls. Yet it was worth seeing, especially in
those days, when few were the unvisited cities of the
world. It has a stirring history, a peculiar race and
language, it coins its own money, and it exports the
finest coffee known. Finally it is the southernmost
town in Tropical Africa.</p>

<p>On April 28th, 1854, in an open boat, I left Aden
alone, without my companions, re-becoming El Hajj
Abdullah, the Arab. My attendants were Mohammed
and Guled, two Somali policemen bound to keep my
secret for the safety of their own throats. I afterwards
engaged one Abdy Abokr, a kind of hedge-priest,
whose nickname was the “End of Time,” meaning
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> of villainy. He was a caution&mdash;&#8203;a
bad tongue, a mischievous brain, covetous and
<!--Page 096-->
wasteful, treacherous as a hyena, revengeful as a
camel, timorous as a jackal.</p>

<p>Three days of summer sail on the “blind billows”
and the “singing waves” of the romantic Arab
geographers landed us at Zayla, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i> Andal, the
classical Sinus Avaliticus, to the south-west of Aden.
During the seventh century it was the capital of a
kingdom which measured forty-three by forty days’
march; now the Bedouin rides up to its walls. The
site is the normal Arabo-African scene, a strip of
sulphur-yellow sand with a deep blue dome above
and a foreground of indigo-coloured sea; behind it
lies the country, a reeking desert of loose white sand
and brown clay, thinly scattered with thorny shrub
and tree. The buildings are a dozen large houses
of mud and coralline rubble painfully whitewashed.
There are six mosques&mdash;&#8203;green little battlemented
things with the Wahhali dwarf tower by way
of minaret, and two hundred huts of dingy palm-leaf.</p>

<p>The population of fifteen thousand souls has not
a good name&mdash;&#8203;Zayla boasting or vanity and Kurayeh
pride is a proverb. They are managed by forty
Turkish soldiers under a Somali Governor, the Hajj
Shermarkuy, meaning “one who sees no harm.”
The tall old man was a brave in his youth; he
could manage four spears, and his sword-cut was
known. He always befriended English travellers.</p>

<p>The only thing in favour of Zayla is its cheapness.
A family of six persons can live well on £30 per
<!--Page 097-->
annum. Being poor, the people are idle, and the
hateful “Inshalla bukra”&mdash;&#8203;“To-morrow if Allah
pleases”&mdash;&#8203;and the Arab “tenha paciencia,” “amanha,”
and “espere um pouco” is the rule.</p>

<p>I was delayed twenty-seven days whilst a route
was debated upon, mules were sent for, camels
were bought, and an abban, or protector-guide, was
secured. Hereabouts no stranger could travel without
such a patron, who was paid to defend his client’s
life and property. Practically he took his money
and ran away.</p>

<p>On the evening of November 27th, 1864, the
caravan was ready. It consisted of five camels laden
with provisions, cooking-pots, ammunition, and our
money&mdash;&#8203;that is to say, beads, coarse tobacco, American
sheeting, Indian cotton, and indigo-dyed stuffs. The
escort was formed by the two policemen, the “End
of Time,” and Yusuf, a one-eyed lad from Zayla, with
the guide and his tail of three followers. My men
were the pink of Somali fashion. They had stained
their hair of a light straw colour by plastering it with
ashes; they had teased it till it stood up a full foot,
and they had mutually spirted upon their wigs melted
tallow, making their heads look like giant cauliflowers
that contrasted curiously with the bistre-coloured
skins. Their tobes (togas) were dazzlingly white,
with borders dazzlingly red. Outside the dress was
strapped a horn-hilted two-edged dagger, long and
heavy; their shields of rhinoceros hide were brand
new, and their two spears poised upon the right
<!--Page 098-->
shoulder were freshly scraped and oiled, and blackened
and polished. They had added my spare rifle and
guns to the camel loads&mdash;&#8203;the things were well enough
in Aden, but in Somali we would deride such strange,
unmanly weapons. They balanced themselves upon
dwarf Abyssinian saddles, extending the leg and
raising the heel like the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute école</i> of Louis <abbr title="fourteen">XIV</abbr>.
The stirrup was an iron ring admitting only the big
toe, and worse than that of the Sertanejo.</p>

<p>As usual in this country, where the gender masculine
will not work, we had two cooks&mdash;&#8203;tall, buxom,
muscular dames, chocolate skinned and round faced.
They had curiously soft and fluted voices, hardly to
be expected from their square and huge-hipped figures,
and contrasting agreeably with the harsh organs of
the men. Their feet were bare, their veil was confined
by a narrow fillet, and the body-cloth was an
indigo-dyed cotton, girt at the waist and graceful
as a winding sheet. I never saw them eat; probably,
as the people say of cooks, they lived by sucking
their fingers.</p>

<p>And here a few words about the Somali, amongst
whom we were to travel. These nomads were not
pure negroes; like the old Egyptians, they were a
mixed breed of African and Arab. The face from
the brow to the nostrils is Asiatic, from the nostrils
to the chin showed traces of negro blood. The hair
was African; they decorated it by a sheep-skin wig
cut to the head and died fiery orange with henna.
The figure was peculiar, the shoulders were high
<!--Page 099-->
and narrow, the trunk was small, the limbs were
spider-like, and the forearm was often of simian
proportions.</p>

<p>The Somali were a free people, lawless as free. The
British Government would not sanction their being
sold as slaves. Of course they enslaved others, and
they had a servile caste called Midyan, who were
the only archers. They had little reverence for their
own chiefs except in council, and they discussed
every question in public, none hesitating to offer the
wildest conjectures. At different times they suggested
that I was a Turk, an Egyptian, a Marah man, a
Banyan, Ahmad the Indian, the Governor of Aden,
a merchant, a pilgrim, the chief of Zayla or his son,
a boy, a warrior in silver armour, an old woman, a
man painted white, and lastly, a calamity sent down
from heaven to tire out the lives of the Somali.</p>

<p>The Somali were bad Moslems, but they believed
in a deity and they knew the name of their Prophet.
Wives being purchased for their value in cows or
camels, the wealthy old were polygamous and the
young poor were perforce bachelors. They worked
milk-pots of tree-fibre like the beer-baskets of Kaffir-land.
They were not bad smiths, but they confined
their work to knives, spear-heads, and neat bits for
their unshod horses. Like the Kaffirs, they called
bright iron “rotten,” and they never tempered it.
Like all Africans, they were very cruel riders.</p>

<p>These nomads had a passion for independence, and
yet when placed under a strong arm they were easily
<!--Page 100-->
disciplined. In British Aden a merry, laughing,
dancing, and fighting race, at home they were a
moping, melancholy people; for this their lives of
perpetual danger might account. This insecurity
made them truly hard-hearted. I have seen them
when shifting camp barbarously leave behind for the
hyenas their sick and decrepit parents. When the
fatal smallpox breaks out, the first cases are often
speared and the huts burned over the still warm
corpse.</p>

<p>The Somali deemed nothing so noble as murder.
The more cowardly the deed is, the better, as showing
the more “nous.” Even the midnight butchery of
a sleeping guest is highly honourable. The hero
plants a rish, or white ostrich feather, in his tufty
pole and walks about the admired of all admirers,
whilst the wives of those who have not received this
order of merit taunt their husbands as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noirs fainéants</i>.
Curious to say, the Greek and Roman officers used
to present these plumes to the bravest of their officers
for wearing on their helmet.</p>

<p>My journey began with the hard alluvial plain,
forty-five to fifty-eight miles broad, between the sea
and the mountains. It belonged to the Eesa, a tribe
of Somali Bedouins, and how these “sun-dwellers”
could exist there was a mystery. On the second
day we reached a kraal consisting of gurgi, or
diminutive hide huts. There was no thorn fence
as is required in the lion-haunted lands to the west.
The scene was characteristic of that pastoral life
<!--Page 101-->
which supplies poetry with Arcadian images and
history with its blackest tragedies. Whistling shepherds,
tall thin men, spear in hand, bore the younglings
of the herd in their bosoms or drove to pasture
the long-necked camels preceded by a patriarch with
a wooden bell. Patches of Persian sheep with snowy
bodies and jetty faces flecked the tawny plain, and
flocks of goats were committed to women dressed
in skins and boys who were unclad till the days of
puberty. Some led the ram, around whose neck a
cord of white heather was tied for luck. Others
frisked with the dogs, animals by no means contemptible
in the eyes of these Bedouin Moslems. All begged
for bori&mdash;&#8203;the precious tobacco&mdash;&#8203;their only narcotic.
They run away if they see smoke, and they suspect
a kettle to be a mortal weapon. So the Bachwanas
called our cannon, “pots.” Many of these wild
people had never tasted grain and had never heard
of coffee or sugar. During the rains they lived on
milk; in the dries they ate meat, avoiding, however,
the blood. Like other races to the north and south,
they would not touch fish or birds, which they compared
to snakes and vultures. “Speak not to me
with that mouth that has tasted fish!” is a dire
insult.</p>

<p>The Eesa were a typical Somali tribe; it might
have numbered one hundred thousand spears, and it
had a bad name. “Treacherous as an Eesa,” is a
proverb at Zayla, where it is said these savages
would offer you a bowl of milk with the left hand
<!--Page 102-->
and would stab you with the right. Their lives were
spent in battle and murder.</p>

<p>The next march, a total of fifty-two miles, nearly
lost us. Just before reaching the mountains which
subtend the coast, we crossed the warm trail of a
razzia, or cavalcade: some two hundred of the Habr
Awal, our inveterate enemies, had been scouring the
country. Robinson Crusoe was less scared by the
footprint than were my companions. Our weak
party numbered only nine men, of whom all except
Mohammed and Guled were useless, and the first
charge would have been certain death.</p>

<p>Escaping this danger, we painfully endured the
rocks and thorns of the mountains and wilds. The
third march placed us at Halimalah, a sacred tree
about half-way between this coast and our destination&mdash;&#8203;Harar.
It is a huge sycamore suggesting the
hiero-sykaminon of Egypt. The Gallas are still
tree-worshippers, and the Somali respect this venerable
vegetable as do the English their Druidical
mistletoe.</p>

<p>We were well received at the kers (the kraals or
villages). They were fenced with large and terrible
thorns, an effectual defence against barelegged men.
The animals had a place apart&mdash;&#8203;semi-circular beehives
made of grass mats mounted on sticks. The furniture
consisted of weapons, hides, wooden pillows and
mats for beds, pots of woven fibre, and horse gear.
We carried our own dates and rice, we bought meat
and the people supplied us with milk gratis&mdash;&#8203;to sell
<!--Page 103-->
it was a disgrace. Fresh milk was drunk only by
the civilised; pastoral people preferred it when artificially
curdled and soured.</p>

<p>We soon rose high above sea-level, as the cold
nights and the burning suns told us. The eighth
march placed us on the Ban Marar, a plain twenty-seven
miles broad&mdash;&#8203;at that season a waterless stubble,
a yellow nap, dotted with thorny trees and bushes,
and at all times infamous for robbery and murder.
It was a glorious place for game: in places it was
absolutely covered with antelopes, and every random
shot must have told in the immense herds.</p>

<p>Here I had the distinction of being stalked by a
lion. As night drew in we were urging our jaded
mules over the western prairie towards a dusky line
of hills. My men proceeded whilst I rode in rear
with a double-barrelled gun at full cock across my
knees. Suddenly my animal trembled and bolted forward
with a sidelong glance of fear. I looked back
and saw, within some twenty yards, the king of beasts
creeping up silently as a cat. To fire both barrels in
the direction of my stalker was the work of a second.
I had no intention of hitting, as aim could not be
taken in the gloaming, and to wound would have been
fatal. The flame and the echoed roar from the hills
made my friend slink away. Its intention was,
doubtless, to crawl within springing distance and then
by a bound on my neck to have finished my journey
through Somaliland and through life. My companions
shouted in horror “Libah! libah!”&mdash;&#8203;“The
<!--Page 104-->
lion! the lion!”&mdash;&#8203;and saw a multitude of lions that
night.</p>

<p>After crossing the desert prairie, we entered the
hills of the agricultural Somali, the threshold of the
South Abyssinian mountains. The pastoral scene
now changed for waving crops of millet, birds in
flights, and hedged lanes, where I saw with pleasure
the dog-rose. Guided by a wild fellow called
Altidon, we passed on to the Sagharah, the village
of the Gerad, or chief, Adan. He had not a good
name, and I was afterwards told he was my principal
danger. But we never went anywhere without our
weapons, and the shooting of a few vultures on the
wing was considered a great feat where small shot is
unknown. “He brings down birds from the sky!”
exclaimed the people.</p>

<p>I must speak of the Gerad, however, as I found
him&mdash;&#8203;a civil and hospitable man, greedy, of course,
suspicious, and of shortsighted policy.</p>

<p>His good and pretty wife Kayrah was very kind, and
supplied me with abundance of honey wine, the merissa
of Abyssinia. It tasted like champagne to a palate
long condemned to total abstinence, without even tea.</p>

<p>We were now within thirty direct miles of Harar,
and my escort made a great stand. The chief Adan
wanted to monopolise us and our goods. My men,
therefore, were threatened with smallpox, the bastinado,
lifelong captivity in unlit dungeons, and similar
amenities.</p>

<p>On June 2nd, 1855, sent for our mules. They
<!--Page 105-->
were missing. An unpleasantness was the consequence,
and the animals appeared about noon. I saddled my
own&mdash;&#8203;no one would assist me. When, mounted and
gun in hand, I rode up to my followers, who sat sulkily
on the ground, and observing that hitherto their acts
had not been those of the brave, I suggested that
before returning to Aden we should do something of
manliness. They arose, begged me not to speak such
words, and offered to advance if I would promise to
reward them should we live and to pay blood-money
to their friends in case of the other contingency.
They apparently attached much importance to what is
vulgarly termed “cutting up well.”</p>

<p>Now, however, we were talking reason, and I
settled all difficulties by leaving a letter addressed to
the Political Resident at Aden. Mohammed and
Guled were chosen to accompany me, the rest remaining
with the Gerad Adan. I must say for my
companions that once in the saddle they shook off
their fears; they were fatalists, and they believed in
my star, whilst they had the fullest confidence in their
pay or pension.</p>

<p>The country now became romantic and beautiful&mdash;&#8203;a
confusion of lofty stony mountains, plantations of the
finest coffee, scatters of villages, forests of noble trees,
with rivulets of the coolest and clearest water. We
here stood some five thousand five hundred feet high,
and although only nine degrees removed from the
Line, the air was light and pleasant. It made me
remember the climate of Aden, and hate it.</p>

<!--Page 106-->
<p>We slept <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>, and on January 3rd we first
sighted Harar City. On the crest of a hill distant
two miles it appeared, a long sombre line strikingly
contrasting with the whitewashed settlements of the
more civilised East, and nothing broke the outline
except the two grey and rudely shaped minarets of the
Jami, or Maritz (cathedral). I almost grudged the
exposure of three lives to win so paltry a prize. But
of all Europeans who had attempted it before me
not one had succeeded in entering that ugly pile of
stones.</p>

<p>We then approached the city gate and sat there, as
is the custom, till invited to enter. Presently we were
ordered to the palace by a chamberlain, a man with
loud and angry voice and eyes.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the palace we dismounted by
command, and we were told to run across the court,
which I refused to do. We were then placed under
a tree in one corner of the yard and to the right of
the palace. The latter is a huge, windowless barn
of rough stone and red clay, without other insignia
but a thin coat of whitewash over the doorway.</p>

<p>Presently we were beckoned in and told to doff our
slippers. A curtain was raised, and we stood in the
presence of the then Amir of Harar, Sultan Ahmed
bin Sultan Abibaki.</p>

<p>The sight was savage, if not imposing. The hall
of audience was a dark room, eighty to ninety feet
long, and its whitewashed walls were hung with rusty
fetters and bright matchlocks. At the further end, on
<!--Page 107-->
a common East Indian cane sofa, sat a small yellow
personage&mdash;&#8203;the great man. He wore a flowing robe
of crimson cloth edged with snowy fur, and a narrow
white turban twisted round a tall conical cap of red
velvet. Ranged in double ranks perpendicular to the
presence and nearest to the chief were his favourites
and courtiers, with right arms bared after the fashion
of Abyssinia. Prolonging these parallel lines towards
the door were Galla warriors, wild men with bushy
wigs. Shining rings of zinc on their arms, wrists,
and ankles formed their principal attire. They stood
motionless as statues; not an eye moved, and each
right hand held up a spear with an enormous head of
metal, the heel being planted in the ground.</p>

<p>I entered with a loud “As ’salem alaykum”&mdash;&#8203;“Peace
be upon ye!”&mdash;&#8203;and the normal answer was
returned. A pair of chamberlains then led me forward
to bow over the chief’s hand. He directed me to sit
on a mat opposite to him, and with lowering brow and
inquisitive glance he asked what might be my business
in Harar. It was the crisis. I introduced myself
as an Englishman from Aden coming to report that
certain changes had taken place there, in the hope
that the “cordial intent” might endure between the
kingdoms of Harar and England.</p>

<p>The Amir smiled graciously. I must admit that
the smile was a relief to me. It was a joy to my
attendants, who sat on the ground behind their master,
grey-brown with emotion, and mentally inquiring,
“What next?”</p>

<!--Page 108-->
<p>The audience over, we were sent to one of the
Amir’s houses, distant about one hundred paces from
the palace. Here cakes of sour maize (fuba), soaked
in curdled milk, and lumps of beef plenteously
powdered with pepper, awaited us. Then we were
directed to call upon Gerad Mohammed, Grand Vizier
of Harar. He received us well, and we retired to rest
not dissatisfied with the afternoon’s work. We had
eaten the chief’s bread and salt.</p>

<p>During my ten days’ stay at Harar I carefully
observed the place and its people. The city was
walled and pierced with five large gates, flanked by
towers, but was ignorant of cannon. The streets&mdash;&#8203;narrow
lanes strewed with rocks and rubbish&mdash;&#8203;were
formed by houses built of granite and sandstone
from the adjacent mountains. The best abodes were
double storied, long and flat roofed, with holes for
windows placed jealously high up, and the doors
were composed of a single plank. The women, I
need hardly say, had separate apartments. The city
abounded in mosques&mdash;&#8203;plain buildings without minarets&mdash;&#8203;and
the graveyards were stuffed with tombs&mdash;&#8203;oblongs
formed by slabs placed edgeways in the ground.</p>

<p>The people, numbering about eight thousand souls,
had a bad name among their neighbours. The Somali
say that Harar is a “paradise inhabited by asses”;
and “hard as the heart of Harar” is a byword.
The junior members of the royal family were imprisoned
till wanted for the throne. Amongst the
men I did not see a handsome face or hear one
<!--Page 109-->
pleasant voice. The features were harsh and plain,
the skin was a sickly brown, the hair and beard
were short and untractable, and the hands and feet
were large and coarse. They were celebrated for
laxity of morals, fondness for strong waters, much
praying, coffee-drinking, and chewing tobacco and
kat, a well-known theme plant. They had a considerable
commerce with the coast, which was reached
by a large caravan once a year.</p>

<p>The women were beautiful by the side of their
lords. They had small heads, regular profiles, straight
noses, large eyes, mouths almost Caucasian, and light
brown skins. The hair, parted in the centre and
gathered into two large bunches behind the ears,
was covered with dark blue muslin or network,
whose ends were tied under the chin. Girls collected
their locks, which were long, thick, and wavy&mdash;&#8203;not
wiry&mdash;&#8203;into a knot <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Diane</i>; a curtain of short
close plaits escaping from the bunch fell upon the
shoulders. The dress was a wide frock of chocolate
or indigo-dyed cotton, girt round the middle with
a sash; before and behind there was a triangle of
scarlet with the point downwards. The ornaments
were earrings and necklaces of black buffalo horn,
the work of Western India. The bosom was
tattooed with stars, the eyebrows were lengthened
with dyes, the eyes were fringed with antimony,
and the palms and soles were stained red. Those
pretty faces had harsh voices, their manners were
rude, and I regret to say that an indiscreet affection
<!--Page 110-->
for tobacco and honey wine sometimes led to a public
bastinado.</p>

<p>At Harar was a university which supplied Somaliland
with poor scholars and crazy priests. There
were no endowments for students&mdash;&#8203;learning was its
own reward&mdash;&#8203;and books (manuscripts) were rare and
costly. Only theology was studied. Some of the
graduates had made a name in the Holy Land of
Arabia, where few ranked higher than my friend Shaykh
Jami el Berteri. To be on the safer side he would
never touch tobacco or coffee. I liked his conversation,
but I eschewed his dinners.</p>

<p>Harar&mdash;&#8203;called Gay or Harar Gay by her sons&mdash;&#8203;is
the capital of Hadiyah, a province of the ancient
Zala empire, and her fierce Moslems nearly extirpated
Christianity from Shoa and Amara. The local
Attila Mohammed Gragne, or the “Left-Handed,”
slew in 1540 David III., the last Ethiopian monarch
who styled himself “King of Kings.”</p>

<p>David’s successor, Claudius, sent imploring messages
to Europe, and D. Joao III. ordered the chivalrous
Stephen and Christopher da Gama, sons of Vasco
da Gama, to the rescue. The Portuguese could
oppose only three hundred and fifty muskets and a
rabble rout of Abyssinians to ten thousand Moslems.
D. Christopher was wounded, taken prisoner, and
decapitated. Good Father Lobo declares that “where
the martyr’s head fell, a fountain sprung up of wonderful
virtue, which cured many hopeless diseases.”</p>

<p>Eventually Gragne was shot by one Pedro Leao,
<!--Page 111-->
a Portuguese soldier who was bent upon revenging
his leader’s fall. The Moslem’s wife, Tamwalbara,
prevented the dispersion of the army, making a slave
personate her dead husband, and drew off his forces
in safety. A strong-minded woman!</p>

<p>My days at Harar were dull enough. At first
we were visited by all the few strangers of the city,
but they soon thought it prudent to shun us. The
report of my “English brethren” being on the coast
made them look upon me as a mufsid, or dangerous
man. The Somali, on the other hand, in compliment
to my attendants, were most attentive. It was
harvest home, and we had opportunity of seeing the
revels of the threshers and reapers&mdash;&#8203;a jovial race,
slightly “dipsomaniac.”</p>

<p>Harar also was the great half-way house and resting
place for slaves between Abyssinia and the coast.
In making purchases, the adage was, “If you want
a brother in battle, buy a Nubian; if you would
be rich, an Abyssinian; if you require an ass, a
negro.”</p>

<p>I sometimes called upon the learned and religious,
but not willingly&mdash;&#8203;these shaykhash, or reverend men,
had proposed detaining me until duly converted
and favoured with a “call.” Harar, like most African
cities, was a prison on a large scale. “You enter it
by your own will; you leave it by another’s,” is
the pithy saw.</p>

<p>At length, when really anxious to depart, and
when my two Somali had consulted their rosaries
<!--Page 112-->
for the thousandth time, I called upon the Gerad
Mohammed, who had always been civil to us. He
was suffering from a chronic bronchitis. Here, then,
lay my chance of escaping from my rat-trap. The
smoke of some brown paper matches steeped in
saltpetre relieved him. We at once made a bargain.
The minister was to take me before the Amir and
secure for me a ceremonious dismission. On the
other part, I bound myself to send up from the
coast a lifelong supply of the precious medicine.
We both kept faith. Moreover, after returning to
Aden I persuaded the authorities to reward with
handsome presents the men who held my life in
their hands and yet did not take it.</p>

<p>After a pleasing interview with the Amir, who did
his best to smile, we left Harar on January 13th,
1855. At Sagharah, where the villagers had prayed
the death-prayer as we set out for the city, we were
received with effusion. They now scattered over
us handfuls of toasted grain, and they danced with
delight, absorbing copious draughts of liquor. The
“End of Time” wept crocodile’s tears, and the
women were grateful that their charms had not
been exposed to the terrible smallpox.</p>

<p>After a week’s rest we prepared to make the coast.
I was desirous of striking Berbera, a port south of
Zayla, where my friends awaited me. The escort
consented to accompany me by the short direct road,
on condition of travelling night and day. They
warned me that they had a blood feud with all the
<!--Page 113-->
tribes on the path, that we should find very little
water and no provisions, and that the heat would
be frightful. Truly, a pleasant prospect for a weary
man!</p>

<p>But if they could stand it, so could I. The weaker
attendants, the women, and the camels were sent back
by the old path, and I found myself <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> on
January 26th, accompanied by my two Somali and
by a wild guide known as Dubayr&mdash;&#8203;the “Donkey.”
My provaunt for five days consisted of five biscuits,
a few limes, and sundry lumps of sugar.</p>

<p>I will not deny that the ride was trying work.
The sun was fearful, the nights were raw and damp.
For twenty-four hours we did not taste water; our
brains felt baked, our throats burned, the mirage
mocked us at every turn, and the effect was a kind
of monomania. At length a small bird showed us a
well and prevented, I believe, our going mad. The
scenery was uniform and uninteresting&mdash;&#8203;horrid hills
upon which withered aloes raised their spears; plains
apparently rained upon by showers of fire and stones,
and rolling ground rich only in “wait a bit” thorns,
made to rend man’s skin and garment. We scrupulously
avoided the kraals, and when on one occasion
the wild people barred the way we were so intolerably
fierce with hunger and thirst that they fled from us
as though we were fiends. The immortal Ten
Thousand certainly did not sight the cold waters of
the Euxine with more delight than we felt when
hailing the warm bay of Berbera. I ended that
<!--Page 114-->
toilsome ride to and from Harar of two hundred
and forty miles at 2 a.m. on January 30th, 1855,
after a last spell of forty miles. A glad welcome
from my brother expeditionists soon made amends
for past privations and fatigues.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>And now to recount the most unpleasant part of
my first adventure in East Africa.</p>

<p>Having paid a visit to Aden, I returned to Berbera
in April, 1855, prepared to march upon the head
waters of the Nile.</p>

<p>But Fate and the British authorities were against
me. I had done too much&mdash;&#8203;I had dared to make
Berbera a rival port. They were not scrupulous at
Aden, even to the taking of life.</p>

<p>My little party consisted of forty-two muskets,
including three officers and myself. The men, however,
were not to be trusted, but after repeated
applications I could not obtain an escort of Somali
policemen. Matters looked ugly, and the more so
as there was no retreat.</p>

<p>The fair of Berbera, which had opened in early
October, was breaking up, and the wild clansmen
were retiring from the seaboard to their native hills.
The harbour rapidly emptied; happily, however, for
us, a single boat remained there.</p>

<p>We slept comfortably on April 18th, agreeing to
have a final shot at the gazelles before marching.
<a name="attack" id="attack"></a>Between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. we were roused by a
rush of men like a roar of a stormy wind. I learned
<!--Page 117-->
afterwards that our enemies numbered between three
and four hundred. We armed ourselves with all
speed, whilst our party, after firing a single volley,
ran away as quickly as possible.</p>

</div>
<!--Page 116--><!--Blank Page-->

<p>The unfortunate Lieutenant Stroyan was run through
with a spear; he slept far from us, and we did not
see him fall. Lieutenants Herne and Speke and I
defended ourselves in our tent till the savages proceeded
to beat it down. I then gave the word to sally,
and cleared the way with my sabre. Lieutenant Herne
accompanied me and&mdash;&#8203;wonderful to relate&mdash;&#8203;escaped
without injury. Lieutenant Speke was seized and
tied up; he had eleven spear-thrusts before he could
free himself, and he escaped by a miracle. When outside
the camp, I vainly tried once more to bring up
our men to the fray. Finding me badly hurt they
carried me on board the boat. Here I was joined by
the survivors, who carried with them the corpse of
our ill-fated friend.</p>

<p>Sad and dispirited, we returned to Aden. We had
lost our property as well as our blood, and I knew too
well that we should be rewarded with nothing but
blame. The authorities held a Court of Inquiry in
my absence, and facetiously found that we and not they
were in fault. Lord Dalhousie, the admirable statesman
then governing in general British India, declared
that they were quite right. I have sometimes thought
they were.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent dropcap">I &thinsp;HAD long wished to “unveil Isis”&mdash;&#8203;in other words,
to discover the sources of the Nile and the Lake
regions of Central Africa&mdash;&#8203;and to this end I left London
in September, 1856, for Bombay. Here I applied for
Captain Speke to accompany me as second in command,
as he wished much to go. My subsequent dispute
with Speke is well known, and I will not refer to it
here. I took him with me out of pure good nature,
for, as he had suffered with me in purse and person
at Berbera the year before, I thought it only just to
offer him the opportunity of renewing an attempt to
penetrate to the unknown regions of Central Africa.
I had no other reasons. He was not a linguist, nor
a man of science, nor an astronomical observer, and
during the expedition he acted in a subordinate capacity
only. The Court of Directors refused him leave, but
I obtained it from the local authorities in Bombay. I
may here add that the Royal Geographical Society had
given me a grant of £1,000, and that the Court of
Directors of the East India Company had given me
two years’ leave.</p>

<p>I landed at Zanzibar from Bombay on December 19th,
<!--Page 122-->
1856, and received much kindness from Lieutenant-Colonel
Hamerton, Her Majesty’s Consul. First of
all I made an experimental trip, and this and the study
of Zanzibar occupied my time until May 14th, 1857,
when I left Zanzibar for the second time, and on the
27th of the same month I landed at Wale Point, on
the east coast of Africa, about eighty-four miles from
the town of Bagamoyo.</p>

<p>I wanted to engage one hundred and seventy porters,
but could only get thirty-six, and thirty animals were
found, which were all dead in six months, so I had
to leave a part of my things behind, including a greater
part of my ammunition and my iron boat. I paid
various visits to the hippopotamus haunts, and had my
boat uplifted from the water upon the points of two
tusks, which made corresponding holes in the bottom.
My escort were under the impression that nothing
less than one hundred and fifty guns and several cannon
would enable them to fight a way through the perils
of the interior. I was warned that I must pass through
savages who shot with poisoned arrows, that I must
avoid trees&mdash;&#8203;which was not easy in a land of forest&mdash;&#8203;that
the Wazaramo had forbidden white men to enter
their country, that one rhinoceros had killed two
hundred men, that armies of elephants would attack
my camp by night, and that the hyena was more
dangerous than the Bengal tiger&mdash;&#8203;altogether, not
a cheerful outlook.</p>

<p>Most of these difficulties were raised by a rascal
named Ramji, who had his own ends in view. Being
<!--Page 123-->
a Hindoo, he thought I was ignorant of Cutchee; so
one day I overheard the following conversation between
him and a native.</p>

<p>“Will he ever reach it?” asked the native, meaning
the Sea of Ujiji; to which Ramji replied:</p>

<p>“Of course not; what is he that he should pass
through Ugogo?” (a province about half way).</p>

<p>So I remarked at once that I did intend to pass
Ugogo and also reach the Sea of Ujiji, that I did
know Cutchee, and that if he was up to any tricks,
I should be equal to him.</p>

<p>On June 26th, 1857, I set out in earnest on a
journey into the far interior.</p>

<p>On this journey I had several queer experiences.
At Nzasa I was visited by three native chiefs, who
came to ascertain whether I was bound on a peaceful
errand. When I assured them of my unwarlike
intentions, they told me I must halt on the morrow
and send forth a message to the next chief, but as
this plan invariably loses three days, I replied that
I could not be bound by their rules, but was ready
to pay for their infraction. During the debate upon
this fascinating proposal for breaking the law, one
of the most turbulent of the Baloch, who were native
servants in my train, drew his sword upon an old
woman because she refused to give up a basket of
grain. She rushed, with the face of a black Medusa,
into the assembly, and created a great disturbance.
When that was allayed, the principal chief asked me
what brought the white man into their country, and
<!--Page 124-->
at the same time to predict the loss of their gains
and commerce, land and liberty.</p>

<p>“I am old,” he quoth pathetically, “and my
beard is grey, yet I never beheld such a calamity as
this.”</p>

<p>“These men,” replied my interpreter, “neither buy
nor sell; they do not inquire into price, nor do
they covet profit.”</p>

<p>An extravagant present&mdash;&#8203;for at that time I
was ignorant of the price I ought to pay&mdash;&#8203;opened
the chiefs’ hearts, and they appointed one of their
body to accompany me as far as the western half
of the Kingani valley. They also caused to be
performed a dance of ceremony in my honour. A
line of small, plump, chestnut-coloured women, with
wild, beady eyes and thatch of clay-plastered hair,
dressed in their loin-cloths, with a profusion of bead
necklaces and other ornaments, and with their ample
bosoms tightly corded down, advanced and retired
in a convulsion of wriggle and contortion, whose fit
expression was a long discordant howl. I threw
them a few strings of green beads, and one of these
falling to the ground, I was stooping to pick it up
when Said, my interpreter whispered, in my ear,
“Bend not; they will say ‘He will not bend even
to take up beads.’”</p>

<p>In some places I found the attentions of the fair
sex somewhat embarrassing, but when I entered the
fine green fields that guarded the settlements of
Muhoewee, I was met <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> by the ladies of the
<!--Page 125-->
villages, who came out to stare, laugh, and wonder
at the white man.</p>

<p>“What would you think of these whites as
husbands?” asked one of the crowd.</p>

<p>“With such things on their legs, not by any
means!” was the unanimous reply, accompanied by
peals of merriment.</p>

<p>On July 8th I fell into what my Arab called the
“Valley of Death and the Home of Hunger,” a
malarious level plain. Speke, whom I shall henceforth
call my companion, was compelled by sickness to ride.
The path, descending into a dense thicket of spear
grass, bush, and thorny trees based on sand, was
rough and uneven, but when I arrived at a ragged
camping kraal, I found the water bad, and a smell
of decay was emitted by the dark, dank ground. It was
a most appalling day, and one I shall not lightly forget.
From the black clouds driven before furious blasts
pattered raindrops like musket bullets, splashing the
already saturated ground. Tall, stiff trees groaned
and bent before the gusts; birds screamed as they
were driven from their resting-places; the asses stood
with heads depressed, ears hung down, and shrinking
tails turned to the wind; even the beasts of the wild
seemed to have taken refuge in their dens.</p>

<p>Despite our increasing weakness, we marched on
the following day, when we were interrupted by a
body of about fifty Wazaramo, who called to us to
halt. We bought them off with a small present of
cloth and beads, and they stood aside to let us pass.
<!--Page 126-->
I could not but admire the athletic and statuesque
figures of the young warriors, and their martial
attitudes, grasping in one hand their full-sized bows,
and in the other sheaths of grinded arrows, whose
black barbs and necks showed a fresh layer of
poison.</p>

<p>Though handicapped by a very inadequate force, in
eighteen days we accomplished, despite sickness and
every manner of difficulty, a march of one hundred
and eighteen miles, and entered K’hutu, the safe
rendezvous of foreign merchants, on July 14th.
I found consolation in the thought that the expedition
had passed without accident through the
most dangerous part of the journey.</p>

<p>Resuming our march through the maritime region,
on July 15th we penetrated into a thick and tangled
jungle, with luxuriant and putrescent vegetation.
Presently, however, the dense thicket opened out into
a fine park country, peculiarly rich in game, where
the giant trees of the seaboard gave way to mimosas,
gums, and stunted thorns. Large gnus pranced
about, pawing the ground and shaking their formidable
manes; hartebeest and other antelopes
clustered together on the plain. The homely cry
of the partridge resounded from the brake, and the
guinea-fowls looked like large bluebells upon the
trees. Small land-crabs took refuge in pits and holes,
which made the path a cause of frequent accidents,
whilst ants of various kinds, crossing the road in
close columns, attacked man and beast ferociously,
<!--Page 127-->
causing the caravan to break into a halting, trotting
hobble. The weather was a succession of raw mists,
rain in torrents, and fiery sunbursts; the land
appeared rotten, and the jungle smelt of death.
At Kiruru I found a cottage and enjoyed for the
first time an atmosphere of sweet, warm smoke. My
companion would remain in the reeking, miry tent,
where he partially laid the foundations of the fever
which afterwards threatened his life in the mountains
of Usagara.</p>

<p>Despite the dangers of hyenas, leopards, and
crocodiles, we were delayed by the torrents of rain
in the depths of the mud at Kiruru. We then
resumed our march under most unpromising conditions.
Thick grass and the humid vegetation
rendered the black earth greasy and slippery, and the
road became worse as we advanced. In three places
we crossed bogs from a hundred yards to a mile in
length, and admitting a man up to the knee. The
porters plunged through them like laden animals,
and I was obliged to be held upon the ass. At last
we reached Dut’humi, where we were detained nearly
a week, for malaria had brought on attacks of marsh
fever, which, in my case, thoroughly prostrated me.
I had during the fever fit, and often for hours afterwards,
a queer conviction of divided identity, never
ceasing to be two persons that generally thwarted and
opposed each other. The sleepless nights brought
with them horrid visions, animals of grisliest form,
and hag-like women and men.</p>

<p><!--Page 128-->
Dut’humi is one of the most fertile districts in
K’hutu, and, despite its bad name as regards climate,
Arabs sometimes reside here for some months for the
purpose of purchasing slaves cheaply, and to repair
their broken fortunes for a fresh trip into the interior.
This kept up a perpetual feud amongst the chiefs of
the country, and scarcely a month passed without
fields being laid waste, villages burnt down, and the
unhappy cultivators being carried off to be sold.</p>

<p>On July 24th, feeling strong enough to advance, we
passed out of the cultivation of Dut’humi. Beyond
the cultivation the road plunged into a jungle, where
the European traveller realised every preconceived idea
of Africa’s aspect at once hideous and grotesque.
The general appearance is a mingling of bush and
forest, most monotonous to the eye. The black, greasy
ground, veiled with thick shrubbery, supports in the
more open spaces screens of tiger and spear grass
twelve and thirteen feet high, with every blade a
finger’s breadth; and the towering trees are often
clothed with huge creepers, forming heavy columns
of densest verdure. The earth, ever rain-drenched,
emits the odour of sulphuretted hydrogen, and in
some parts the traveller might fancy a corpse to
be hidden behind every bush. That no feature of
miasma might be wanting to complete the picture,
filthy heaps of the meanest hovels sheltered their
miserable inhabitants, whose frames are lean with
constant intoxication, and whose limbs are distorted
with ulcerous sores. Such a revolting scene is
<!--Page 129-->
East Africa from Central K’hutu to the base of the
Usagara Mountains.</p>

<p>After a long, long tramp the next day through rice
swamps, we came to the nearest outposts of the
Zungomero district. Here were several caravans,
with pitched tents, piles of ivory, and crowds of
porters. The march had occupied us over four
weeks, about double the usual time, and a gang of
thirty-six Wanyamwezi native porters whom I had
sent on in advance to Zungomero naturally began to
suspect accident.</p>

<p>Zungomero was not a pleasant place, and though
the sea breeze was here strong, beyond its influence
the atmosphere was sultry and oppressive. It was the
great centre of traffic in the eastern regions. Lying
upon the main trunk road, it must be traversed by
the up and down caravans, and during the travelling
season, between June and April, large bodies of some
thousand men pass through it every week. It was,
therefore, a very important station, and the daily
expenditure of large caravans being considerable, there
was a good deal of buying and selling.</p>

<p>The same attractions which draw caravans to
Zungomero render it the great rendezvous of an
army of touts, who, whilst watching the arrival of
ivory traders, amuse themselves with plundering the
country.</p>

<p>Zungomero is the end of the maritime region, and
when I had reached it, I considered that the first
stage of my journey was accomplished.</p>

<p><!--Page 130-->
I had to remain at Zungomero about a fortnight
to await the coming of my porters. In this hot-bed
of pestilence we nearly found “wet graves.” Our
only lodging was under the closed eaves of a hut,
built African fashion, one abode within the other;
the roof was a sieve, the walls were a system of
chinks, and the floor was a sheet of mud. Outside
the rain poured pertinaciously, the winds were raw
and chilling, and the gigantic vegetation was sopped
to decay, and the river added its quotum of miasma.
The hardships of the march had upset our Baloch
guard, and they became almost mutinous, and would
do nothing for themselves. They stole the poultry
of the villagers, quarrelled violently with the slaves,
and foully abused their temporal superior, Said bin
Salim.</p>

<p>When we were ready to start from Zungomero,
our whole party amounted to a total of one hundred
and thirty-two souls, whom I need not, I think,
describe in detail. We had plenty of cloth and
beads for traffic with the natives, a good store of
provisions, arms, and ammunition, a certain amount
of camp furniture, instruments, such as chronometers,
compasses, thermometers, etc., a stock of stationery,
plenty of useful tools, clothing, bedding, and shoes,
books and drawing materials, a portable domestic
medicine chest, and a number of miscellaneous articles.
As life at Zungomero was the acme of discomfort,
I was glad enough to leave it.</p>

<p>On August 7th, 1857, our expedition left Zungomero
<!--Page 131-->
to cross the East African ghauts in rather
a pitiful plight. We were martyred by miasma;
my companion and I were so feeble that we could
hardly sit our asses, and we could scarcely hear. It
was a day of severe toil, and we loaded with great
difficulty.</p>

<p>From Central Zungomero to the nearest ascent
of the Usagara Mountains is a march of five hours;
and, after a painful and troublesome journey, we
arrived at the frontier of the first gradient of the
Usagara Mountains. Here we found a tattered kraal,
erected by the last passing caravan, and, spent with
fatigue, we threw ourselves on the short grass to
rest. We were now about three hundred feet above
the plain level, and there was a wondrous change
of climate. Strength and health returned as if by
magic; the pure sweet mountain air, alternately
soft and balmy, put new life into us. Our gipsy
encampment was surrounded by trees, from which
depended graceful creepers, and wood-apples large as
melons. Monkeys played at hide-and-seek, chattering
behind the bolls, as the iguana, with its painted
scale-armour, issued forth; white-breasted ravens
cawed, doves cooed on well-clothed boughs, and the
field cricket chirped in the shady bush. By night
the view disclosed a peaceful scene, the moonbeams
lying like sheets of snow upon the ruddy highlands,
and the stars shone like glow-lamps in the dome
above. I never wearied of contemplating the scene,
and contrasting it with the Slough of Despond,
<!--Page 132-->
unhappy Zungomero. We stayed here two days,
and then resumed our upward march.</p>

<p>All along our way we were saddened by the sight
of clean-picked skeletons and here and there the
swollen corpses of porters who had perished by the
wayside. A single large body passed us one day,
having lost fifty of their number by smallpox, and
the sight of their deceased comrades made a terrible
impression. Men staggered on, blinded by disease;
mothers carried infants as loathsome as themselves.
He who once fell never rose again. No village
would admit a corpse into its precincts, and they
had to lie there until their agony was ended by the
vulture, the raven, and the hyena. Several of my
party caught the infection, and must have thrown
themselves into the jungle, for when they were
missed they could not be found. The farther we
went on, the more we found the corpses; it was a
regular way of death. Our Moslems passed them
with averted faces, and with the low “La haul”
of disgust.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Rufutah, I found that nearly
all our instruments had been spoilt or broken; and
one discomfort followed another until we arrived at
Zonhwe, which was the turning-point of our expedition’s
difficulties.</p>

<p>As we went on, the path fell easily westwards
through a long, grassy incline, cut by several water-courses.
At noon I lay down fainting in the sandy
bed of the Muhama, and, keeping two natives with
<!--Page 133-->
me, I begged my companion to go on, and send
me back a hammock from the halting-place. My
men, who before had become mutinous and deserting,
when they saw my extremity came out well;
even the deserters reappeared, and they led me to
a place where stagnant water was found, and said
they were sorry. At two o’clock, as my companion
did not send a hammock, I remounted, and passed
through several little villages. I found my caravan
halted on a hillside, where they had been attacked
by a swarm of wild bees.</p>

<p>Our march presented curious contrasts of this
strange African nature, which is ever in extremes.
At one time a splendid view would charm me;
above, a sky of purest azure, flecked with fleecy
clouds. The plain was as a park in autumn, burnt
tawny by the sun. A party was at work merrily,
as if preparing for an English harvest home.
Calabashes and clumps of evergreen trees were
scattered over the scene, each stretching its lordly
arms aloft. The dove, the peewit, and the guinea-fowl
fluttered about. The most graceful of animals,
the zebra and the antelope, browsed in the distance.
Then suddenly the fair scene would vanish as if
by enchantment. We suddenly turned into a tangled
mass of tall, fœtid reeds, rank jungle, and forest.
After the fiery sun and dry atmosphere of the
plains, the sudden effect of the damp and clammy
chill was overpowering. In such places one feels
as if poisoned by miasma; a shudder runs through
<!--Page 134-->
the frame, and cold perspiration breaks over the
brow.</p>

<p>So things went on until September 4th, which
still found us on the march. We had reached the
basin of Inenge, which lies at the foot of the Windy
Pass, the third and westernmost range of the Usagara
Mountains. The climate is ever in extremes; during
the day a furnace, and at night a refrigerator. Here
we halted. The villagers of the settlements overlooking
the ravine flocked down to barter their
animals and grain.</p>

<p>The halt was celebrated by abundant drumming
and droning, which lasted half the night; it served
to raise the spirits of the men, who had talked of
nothing the whole day but the danger of being
attacked by the Wahumba, a savage tribe. The
next morning there arrived a caravan of about four
hundred porters, marching to the coast under the
command of some Arab merchants. We interchanged
civilities, and I was allured into buying a few yards
of rope and other things, and also some asses. One
of my men had also increased his suite, unknown
to me at first, by the addition of Zawada&mdash;&#8203;the
“Nice Gift.” She was a woman of about thirty,
with black skin shining like a patent leather boot, a
bulging brow, little red eyes, a wide mouth, which
displayed a few long, scattered teeth, and a figure
considerably too bulky for her thin legs. She was
a patient and hardworking woman, and respectable
enough in the acceptation of the term. She was
<!--Page 135-->
at once married off to old Musangesi, one of the
donkey-men, whose nose and chin made him a
caricature of our old friend Punch. After detecting
her in a lengthy walk, perhaps not a solitary one,
he was guilty of such cruelty to her that I felt
compelled to decree a dissolution of the marriage,
and she returned safely to Zanzibar. At Inenge
another female slave was added to our troop in
the person of Sikujui&mdash;&#8203;“Don’t Know”&mdash;&#8203;a herculean
person with a virago manner. The channel of her
upper lip had been pierced to admit a bone, which
gave her the appearance of having a duck’s bill.
“Don’t Know’s” morals were frightful. She was
duly espoused, in the forlorn hope of making her a
respectable woman, to Goha, the sturdiest of the
Wak’hutu porters; after a week she treated him
with sublime contempt. She gave him first one and
then a dozen rivals, and she disordered the whole
caravan with her irregularities, in addition to breaking
every article entrusted to her charge, and at last
deserted shamelessly, so that her husband finally disposed
of her to a travelling trader in exchange for
a few measures of rice. Her ultimate fate I do not
know, but the trader came next morning to complain
of a broken head.</p>

<p>After Inenge we were in for a bad part of the
journey, and great labour. Trembling with ague,
with swimming heads, ears deafened by weakness, and
limbs that would hardly support us, we contemplated
with horrid despair the apparently perpendicular path
<!--Page 136-->
up which we and our starving asses were about
to toil.</p>

<p>On September 10th we hardened our hearts and
began to breast the Pass Terrible. After rounding
in two places wall-like sheets of rock and crossing a
bushy slope, we faced a long steep of loose white soil
and rolling stones, up which we could see the porters
swarming more like baboons than human beings, and
the asses falling every few yards. As we moved
slowly and painfully forward, compelled to lie down
by cough, thirst, and fatigue, the sayhah, or war-cry,
rang loud from hill to hill, and Indian files of
archers and spearmen streamed like lines of black
ants in all directions down the paths. The predatory
Wahumba, awaiting the caravan’s departure,
had seized the opportunity of driving the cattle and
plundering the village of Inenge.</p>

<p>By resting every few yards, we reached, after about
six hours, the summit of the Pass Terrible, and here
we sat down amongst aromatic flowers and pretty
shrubs to recover strength and breath.</p>

<p>On September 14th, our health much improved
by the weather, we left the hilltop and began to
descend the counterslope of the Usagara Mountains.
For the first time since many days I had strength
enough to muster the porters and inspect their loads.
The outfit which had been expected to last a year had
been half exhausted within three months. I summoned
Said bin Salim, and told him my anxiety. Like a
veritable Arab, he declared we had enough to last until
<!--Page 137-->
we reached Unyamyembe, where we should certainly
be joined by reinforcements of porters.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Allah is all-knowing,” said Said. “The caravan
will come.”</p>

<p>As the fatalism was infectious, I ceased to think
upon the subject.</p>

<p>The next day we sighted the plateau of Ugogo and
its eastern desert. The spectacle was truly impressive.
The first aspect was stern and wild&mdash;&#8203;the rough nurse
of rugged men. We went on the descent from day
to day until September 18th, when a final march of
four hours placed us on the plains of Ugogo. Before
noon I sighted from a sharp turn in the bed of a river
our tent pitched under a huge sycamore, on a level
step. It was a pretty spot in the barren scene, grassy,
and grown with green mimosas, and here we halted
for a while. The second stage of our journey was
accomplished.</p>

<p>After three days’ sojourn at Ugogo to recruit the
party and lay in rations for four long desert marches,
we set forth on our long march through the province
of Ugogo. Our first day’s journey was over a grassy
country, and we accomplished it in comparative comfort.
The next day we toiled through the sunshine
of the hot waste, crossing plains over paths where the
slides of elephants’ feet upon the last year’s muddy
clay showed that the land was not always dry. During
this journey we suffered many discomforts and difficulties.
The orb of day glowed like a fireball in our
<!--Page 138-->
faces; then our path would take us through dense,
thorny jungle, and over plains of black, cracked earth.
Our caravan once rested in a thorny copse based upon
rich red and yellow clay; once it was hurriedly
dislodged by a swarm of wild bees, and the next
morning I learnt that we had sustained a loss&mdash;&#8203;one
of our porters had deserted, and to his care had been
committed one of the most valuable of our packages,
a portmanteau containing “The Nautical Almanac,”
surveying books, and most of our papers, pen, and ink.</p>

<p>At last we arrived at Ziwa, a place where caravans
generally encamped, because they found water there.
At Ziwa we had many troubles. One Marema, the
Sultan of a new settlement, visited us on the day of
our arrival, and reproved us for sitting in the jungle,
pointing the way to his village. On my replying we
were going to traverse Ugogo by another road, he
demanded his customs, which we refused, as they were
a form of blackmail. The Sultan threatened violence,
whereupon the asses were brought in from grazing
and ostentatiously loaded before his eyes. He then
changed his tone from threats to beggary. I gave
him two cloths and a few strings of beads, preferring
this to the chance of a flight of arrows during the
night.</p>

<p>When we resumed our journey, the heat was awful.
The sun burnt like the breath of a bonfire, warm
siroccos raised clouds of dust, and in front of us the
horizon was so distant that, as the Arabs expressed
themselves, a man might be seen three marches off.</p>

<p><!--Page 139-->
October 5th saw us in the centre of Kanyenye,
a clearing in the jungle of about ten miles in diameter.
The surface was of a red clayey soil dotted with
small villages, huge calabashes, and stunted mimosas.
Here I was delayed four days to settle blackmail with
Magomba, the most powerful of the Wagogo chiefs.
He was of a most avaricious nature. First of all I
acknowledged his compliments with two cottons.
On arrival at his headquarters, I was waited on by
an oily Cabinet of Elders, who would not depart
without their “respects”&mdash;&#8203;four cottons. The next
demand was made by his favourite, a hideous old
Princess with more wrinkles than hair, with no hair
black and no tooth white; she was not put right
without a fee of six cottons. At last, accompanied
by a mob of courtiers, appeared the chief <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in magnifico</i>.
He was the only chief who ever entered my tent in
Ugogo&mdash;&#8203;pride and a propensity for strong drink
prevented such visits. He was much too great a
man to call upon Arab merchants, but in our case
curiosity mastered State considerations. Magomba
was an old man, black and wrinkled, drivelling and
decrepid. He wore a coating of castor-oil and a loin-cloth
which grease and use had changed from blue
to black. He chewed his quid, and expectorated
without mercy; he asked many questions, and was
all eyes to the main chance. He demanded, and
received, five cloths, one coil of brass wire, and four
blue cottons. In return he made me a present of
the leanest of calves, and when it was driven into
<!--Page 140-->
camp with much parade, his son, to crown all, put
in a claim for three cottons. Yet Magomba, before
our departure, boasted of his generosity&mdash;&#8203;and indeed
he was generous, for everything we had was in his
hands, and we were truly in his power. It was, indeed,
my firm conviction from first to last in this expedition
that in case of attack or surprise by natives I had
not a soul except my companion to stand by me,
and all those who accompanied us would have either
betrayed us or fled. We literally, therefore, carried
our lives in our hands.</p>

<p>We toiled on and on, suffering severely from the
heat by day and sometimes the cold by night, and
troubled much with mutinous porters and fears of
desertion, until at last we reached the heart of the
great desert, or elephant ground, known as Fiery
Field. On October 20th we began the transit of this
Fiery Field. The waste here appeared in its most
horrid phase; a narrow goat-path serpentined in and
out of a growth of poisonous thorny jungle, with
thin, hard grass straw growing on a glaring white
and rolling ground. The march was a severe trial,
and we lost on it three boxes of ammunition. By-and-by
we passed over the rolling ground, and plunged
into a thorny jungle, which seemed interminable, but
which gradually thinned out into a forest of thorns
and gums, bush and underwood, which afforded a
broad path and pleasanter travelling. Unfortunately,
it did not last long, and we again had a very rough
bit of ground to go over. Another forest to pass
<!--Page 141-->
through, and then we came out on October 27th
into a clearing studded with large stockaded villages,
fields of maize and millet, gourds and watermelons,
and showing numerous flocks and herds. We had
arrived at Unyamwezi, and our traverse of Ugogo
was over.</p>

<p>The people swarmed from their abodes, young and
old hustling one another for a better stare; the man
forsook his loom and the girl her hoe, and we were
welcomed and escorted into the village by a tail of
screaming boys and shouting adults, the males almost
nude, the women bare to the waist, and clothed only
knee-deep in kilts. Leading the way, our guide,
according to the immemorial custom of Unyamwezi,
entered uninvited and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</i> the nearest
village; the long string of porters flocked in with bag
and baggage, and we followed their example. We
were placed under a wall-less roof, bounded on one
side by the bars of the village palisade, and surrounded
by a mob of starers, who relieved one another from
morning to night, which made me feel like a wild
beast in a menagerie.</p>

<p>We rested some days at Unyamwezi&mdash;&#8203;the far-famed
“Land of the Moon”&mdash;&#8203;but I was urged to advance
on the ground that the natives were a dangerous race,
though they appeared to be a timid and ignoble
people, dripping with castor and sesamum oil, and
scantily attired in shreds of cotton or greasy goat-skins.
The dangers of the road between Unyamwezi and
Ujiji were declared to be great. I found afterwards
<!--Page 142-->
that they were grossly exaggerated, but I set forth
with the impression that this last stage of my journey
would be the worst of all. The country over which
we travelled varied very much from day to day, being
sometimes opened and streaked with a thin forest of
mimosas, and at other times leading us through jungly
patches. Going through a thick forest, one of the
porters, having imprudently lagged behind, was clubbed
and cruelly bruised by three black robbers, who relieved
him of his load. These highwaymen were not unusual
in this part, and their raids formed one of the many
dangers we had to guard against.</p>

<p>On November 7th, 1857, the one hundred and
thirty-fourth day from the date of leaving the coast,
we entered Kazeh, the principal village of Unyamwezi,
much frequented by Arab merchants. I always got
on well with the Arabs, and they gave me a most
favourable reception. Striking indeed was the contrast
between the open-handed hospitality and hearty
goodwill of this truly noble race and the niggardliness
of the savage and selfish Africans. Whatever I
alluded to&mdash;&#8203;onions, plantains, limes, vegetables, tamarinds,
coffee, and other things, only to be found
amongst the Arabs&mdash;&#8203;were sent at once, and the very
name of payment would have been an insult.</p>

<p>Kazeh is situated in Unyamyembe, the principal
province of Unyamwezi, and is a great meeting-place
of merchants and point of departure for caravans,
which then radiate into the interior of Central
Intertropical Africa. Here the Arab merchant from
<!--Page 143-->
Zanzibar meets his compatriot returning from the
Tanganyika and Uruwwa. Many of the Arabs settle
here for years, and live comfortably, and even
splendidly. Their houses, though single storied, are
large, substantial, and capable of defence; their
gardens are extensive and well planted. They receive
regular supplies of merchandise, comforts, and luxuries
from the coast; they are surrounded by troops of
concubines and slaves; rich men have riding asses
from Zanzibar, and even the poorest keep flocks
and herds.</p>

<p>I was detained at Kazeh from November 8th until
December 14th, and the delay was one long trial
of patience.</p>

<p>It is customary for stranger caravans proceeding
towards Ujiji to remain six weeks or two months
at Unyamyembe for repose and recovery from the
labours which they have endured; moreover, they
are expected to enjoy the pleasures of civilised
society, and to accept the hospitality offered them
by the resident Arabs. In Eastern Africa, I may
mention, six weeks was the same as the three days’
visit in England.</p>

<p>The morning after our arrival at Kazeh a great
number of our porters left us, and the rest of our
party apparently considered that Unyamyembe, and
not Ujiji, was the end of the exploration. Several
of them were mutinous when I told them they
would not be rewarded for safe-conduct until we
had reached the end of the up march, which was not
<!--Page 144-->
here; and these difficulties took a long time to settle.
Kazeh, indeed, proved in effect a second point of
departure, easier only because I had now gained
some experience. Another cause of delay was the
sickness of many of our people, and it took some
time for them to shake off the ague which they had
contracted. Indeed, the wing of Azrael seemed
waving over my own head. Nevertheless, on the
morning of December 15th I started off afresh,
charmed with the prospect of a fine open country,
and delighted to get away from what had been to
me a veritable imprisonment.</p>

<p>I will not describe the details of our march, which
went on without a break. Christmas Day found us
still marching, and so on day after day, if I except
an enforced halt of twelve days at Msene. On
January 10th, 1858, I left Msene, with considerable
difficulty through the mutiny of porters; and so we
pressed on, more or less with difficulty, until at last
a formidable obstacle to progress presented itself.
I had been suffering for some days; the miasmatic
airs of Sorora had sown the seeds of a fresh illness.
On the afternoon of January 18th, 1858, I was seized
with an attack of fever, and then paralysis set in
from the feet upwards, and I was completely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors
de combat</i>. There seemed nothing left for me but
to lie down and die. One of my chief porters
declared that the case was beyond his skill: it was
one of partial paralysis, brought on by malaria, and
he called in an Arab, who looked at me also. The
<!--Page 145-->
Arab was more cheerful, and successfully predicted
that I should be able to move in ten days. On
the tenth I again mounted my ass, but the paralysis
wore off very slowly, and prevented me from walking
any distance for nearly a year. The sensation
of numbness in my hands and feet disappeared even
more slowly than that. I had, however, undertaken
the journey in a “nothing like leather” frame of
mind, and was determined to press on. So we pressed.</p>

<p>We had now left the “Land of the Moon” behind
us, and entered upon a new district. The road
before us lay through a howling wilderness, and
the march lay along the right bank of a malarial
river, and the mosquitoes feasted right royally upon
our bodies, even in the daytime. A good deal of
the ground was very swampy, and it then stretched
over jungly and wooded hill-spires, with steep
ascents and descents. Everywhere was thick, fœtid,
and putrescent vegetation. The heaviness of this
march caused two of our porters to levant and
another four to strike work. It was, therefore, necessary
for me to again mount ass ten days after
an attack of paralysis. So we dragged on for the
next week, throughout the early days of February,
a weary toil of fighting through tiger and spear
grass, over broken and slippery paths, and through
thick jungle. But these difficulties were lightly
borne, for we felt that we must be nearing the end
of our journey.</p>

<p>On February 13th we resumed our travel through
<!--Page 146-->
screens of lofty grass, which thinned out into a
straggling forest. After about an hour’s march, as
we entered a small savannah, I saw our Arab leader
running forward and changing the direction of the
caravan. Presently he breasted a steep and stony
hill, sparsely clad with thorny trees. Arrived at the
summit with toil, for our fagged beasts now refused
to proceed, we halted for a few minutes and gazed.</p>

<p>“What is that streak of light which lies below?”
I inquired of Seedy Bombay, one of our porters.</p>

<p>“I am of opinion,” quoth Seedy, “that is the
water.”</p>

<p>I gazed in dismay. The remains of my blindness,
the veil of trees, and broad ray of sunshine illuminating
but one reach of the lake, had shrunk its
fair proportions. Prematurely I began to curse my
folly in having risked life and health for so poor
a prize, and even thought of proposing an immediate
return with a view of exploring the Nyanza, or
Northern Lake. Advancing, however, a few yards,
the whole scene suddenly burst upon my view, filling
me with wonder, admiration, and delight. My
longing eyes beheld the Tanganyika Lake as it lay
in the lap of the mountain, basking in the gorgeous
tropical sunshine. Our journey had not been in vain.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="title">THE LAKE REGIONS</span></h4>

<p>I <span class="sc">shall</span> never forget my first glimpse of Tanganyika.
Below and beyond a short foreground of rugged
and precipitous hill-fold, down which the footpath
zigzagged painfully, a narrow strip of emerald green
shelved towards a ribbon of glistening yellow sand,
here bordered by sedgy rushes, there cleanly cut by
the breaking wavelets. Further in front stretched
the waters, an expanse of soft blue, in breadth varying
from thirty to thirty-five miles, and sprinkled by
the crisp east wind with tiny crescents of snowy foam.
The background in front was a high and broken
wall of steel-coloured mountain. To the south, and
opposite the long, low point, lay bluff headlands, and,
as the eye dilated, it fell upon a cluster of outlying
islets, speckling a sea horizon. Villages, cultivated
lands, the frequent canoes of the fishermen on the
waters, and, as we came nearer, the murmur of the
waters breaking upon the shore, gave variety and
movement to the landscape. The riant shores of
this vast lake appeared doubly beautiful to me after
the silent and spectral mangrove creeks on the East
African seaboard, and the melancholy, mononotous
<!--Page 148-->
experience I had gone through of desert and jungle,
tawny rock and sunburnt plain, or rank herbage
and flats of black mire. Truly it was a feast of
soul and sight. Forgetting toils, dangers, and the
doubtfulness of return, I felt willing to endure double
what I had endured. I had sighted the fabled lake,
and all the party seemed to join with me in joy.
Even my purblind companion found nothing to
grumble at except the “mist and glare before his
eyes.”</p>

<p>Arrived at Ukaranga I was disappointed to find
there a few miserable grass huts that clustered around
a single “tembe,” or inn, then occupied by its proprietor,
an Arab trader. I found that that part of
Ukaranga contained not a single native canoe, and
there seemed no possibility of getting one, the innkeeper
being determined that I should spend beads for
rations and lodgings among him and his companions,
and be heavily mulcted for a boat into the bargain.
The latter manœuvre was frustrated by my securing
a solid-built Arab craft for the morrow, capable of
containing from thirty to thirty-five men. It belonged
to an absent merchant, and in point of size it was
second on Tanganyika, and, being too large for
paddling, the crew rowed, instead of scooping up the
water like the natives. I paid an exorbitant price
for the hire of this boat.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the following day, February
14th, we began coasting along the eastern shore of
the lake in a north-westerly direction, towards the
<!--Page 149-->
Kawele district, in the land of Ujiji. The view was
exceedingly beautiful, and the picturesque and varied
forms of the mountains, rising above and dipping
into the lake, were clad in purplish blue, set off by
the rosy tints of the morning. As we approached
our destination, I wondered at the absence of houses
and people. By the Arabs I had been taught to
expect a town, a port, and a bazaar excelling in
size that of Zanzibar, instead of which I found a
few scattered hovels, and our craft was poled up
through a hole in a thick welting of coarse grass
to a level landing-place of flat shingle. Such was
the disembarkation quay of the great Ujiji.</p>

<p>We stepped ashore. Around the landing-place
a few scattered huts represented the port-town.
Advancing some hundred yards through a din of
shouts and screams, tom-toms and trumpets, which
defies description, and mobbed by a swarm of black
beings whose eyes seemed about to start from their
heads with surprise, I passed a relic of Arab civilisation,
the bazaar. It was on a plot of higher ground, and
there, between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., weather permitting,
a mass of standing and squatting negroes buy and
sell, barter and exchange, offer and chaffer, with
a hubbub heard for miles. The articles exposed for
sale were sometimes goats and sheep and poultry,
generally fish, vegetables, and a few fruits, and palm
wine was a staple commodity. Occasionally an ivory or
a slave was hawked about. Such was the little village
of Kawele. The Tanganyika is ever seen to advantage
<!--Page 150-->
from its shores, and here I found a lodging in a
ruinous tembe inn, built by an Arab merchant,
where I was lodged in comparative comfort, though
the tembe was tenanted only by ticks and slaves.</p>

<p>As the tembe was to be my home for a space,
my first care was to purify the floor by pastilles of
asafœtida and fumigations of gunpowder; the second
to prepare the roof for the rainy season. Improvement,
however, was slow, for the natives were too
lazy to work, and the porters took the earliest
opportunity of deserting. I, however, managed to
provide a pair of cartels, with substitutes for chairs
and tables. Benches of clay were built round the
rooms, but they proved useless, being found regularly
every morning occupied in force by a swarming,
struggling colony of white ants. The roof, long
overgrown with tall grass, was fortified with mud;
it never ceased, however, to leak like a colander, and
presently the floor was covered with deep puddles,
then masses of earth dropped from the soft sides of
the walls, and, at last, during the violent showers,
half the building fell in.</p>

<p>On the second day of my arrival I was called
upon by Kannena, the headman of Kawele. He was
introduced, habited in silk turban and a broadcloth
coat, which I afterwards heard he had borrowed from
the Baloch. His aspect was truly ignoble; a short,
squat, and broad-backed figure, and his apology for
a nose much resembled the pug with which the
ancients provided Silenus. On this, his first appearance,
<!--Page 151-->
he behaved with remarkable civility, and
proceeded to levy his blackmail, which was finally
settled at ten coil-bracelets and two fundi of beads.
I had no salt to spare, or much valuable merchandise
might have been saved. Their return was six small
bundles of grain. Then Kannena opened trade by
sending us a nominal gift, a fine ivory, weighing at
least seventy pounds, and worth, perhaps, £100.
After keeping it a day or two I returned it,
saying I had no dealings in ivory and slaves.
This, it appears, was a mistake, as I ought, by a
trifling outlay, to have supported the character of a
trader. The Wajiji did not understand. “These
are men who live by doing nothing!” they exclaimed,
and they lost no time in requesting me to quit
their territory. To this I objected, and endeavoured
to bribe them off. My bribes, I suppose, were not
sufficient, for we at once began to see the dark side
of the native character. Thieves broke into our
out-houses, our asses were wounded by spears, and
we were accused of having bewitched and killed
their cattle. Still, other travellers fared even worse
than we did.</p>

<p>At first the cold, damp climate of the lake regions
did not agree with us; perhaps, too, the fish diet
was over-rich and fat, and the abundance of vegetables
led to little excesses. All energy seemed to have
abandoned us. I lay for a fortnight upon the earth,
too blind to read and write except at long intervals,
too weak to ride, and too ill to talk. My companion,
<!--Page 152-->
Speke, who, when we arrived at the Tanganyika
Lake, was almost as groggy upon his legs as I was,
suffered from a painful ophthalmia and a curious
distortion of face, which made him chew sideways,
like a ruminant. The Baloch complained of influenzas
and catarrhs, and their tempers were as sore as their
lungs and throats.</p>

<p>But work remained undone, and it was necessary
to awaken from my lethargy. Being determined to
explore the northern extremity of the Tanganyika
Lake, whence, according to several informants, issued
a large river flowing northwards, I tried to hire
from an Arab merchant the only dhow, or sailing
boat, then in existence, since the wretched canoes of
the people were quite unfit for a long cruise. I
entrusted the mission first of all to my Arab, Said
bin Salim, but he shirked it, and I therefore directed
my companion to do his best. I got the dhow, and
set about stocking it with provisions for a month’s
cruise. I had great difficulty in obtaining sufficient
provisions, the prices demanded were so exorbitant.
After many delays I at last sent my companion away,
supplied with an ample outfit, escorted by two Baloch,
and attended by his men, across the Bay of Ukaranga.
I was then left alone.</p>

<p>During my twenty-seven days of solitude the time
sped quickly; it was chiefly spent in eating and
drinking, dozing and smoking. Awaking at 2 a.m.
or 3 a.m., I lay anxiously expecting the grey light
creeping through the door chinks; the glad tidings of
<!--Page 153-->
its approach were announced by the cawing of the
crows and the crowing of the village cocks. When
the golden rays began to stream over the red earth,
my torpid servant was called out, and he brought me
a mass of suji, or rice-flour boiled in water, with a
little cold milk as a relish. Then entered the
“slavey” of the establishment, armed with a leafy
branch, to sweep the floor and slay the huge wasps
that riddled the walls of the tenement. This done,
he lit the fire, as the excessive damp rendered
this precaution necessary. Then ensued visits of
ceremony from Said bin Salim and another, who
sat, stared, and seeing that I was not yet dead,
showed disappointment in their faces and walked
away. So the morning wore on. My servant was
employed with tailoring, gun-cleaning, and similar
light work, over which he grumbled perpetually,
whilst I settled down to diaries and vocabularies,
a process interrupted by sundry pipes. We had
two hours’ sleep at noon, and I may say that most
of the day I lay like a log upon my cot, smoking
almost uninterruptedly, dreaming of things past and
visioning things present, and sometimes indulging
myself in a few lines of reading and writing.</p>

<p>Dinner was an alternation of fish and fowl, butchers’
meat being extremely rare at Ujiji. At evening I
used to make an attempt to sit under the broad eaves
of the tembe and enjoy the delicious spectacle of
this virgin nature. I was still very weak.</p>

<p>At 7 p.m., as the last flush faded from the occident,
<!--Page 154-->
the lamp, a wick in a pot full of palm oil, was brought
in, Said bin Salim would appear, and a brief conversation
led to the hour of sleep. A dreary, dismal
day, yet it had its enjoyments.</p>

<p>On March 29th the rattling of the matchlocks
announced my companion’s return. I never saw a
man so thoroughly moist and mildewed; he justified
even the French phrase, “Wet to the bone.”
His paraphernalia were in a similar state; his guns
were grained with rust, and his fireproof powder
magazine had admitted the monsoon rain. I was
sorely disappointed; he had done literally nothing.
I cannot explain where the mismanagement lay, but
the result was that he had come back to me without
boat or provisions to report ill-success.</p>

<p>It now became apparent that the rainy season was
drawing to a close, and the time for navigation was
beginning. After some preliminaries with Said bin
Salim, Kannena, who had been preparing for a cruise
northward, was summoned before me. He agreed
to convey me; but when I asked him the conditions
on which he would show me the mtoni, or river,
he jumped up, discharged a volley of oaths, and
sprang from the house like a baboon. I was resolved,
however, at all costs, even if we were reduced to
actual want, to visit this mysterious stream. I made
other overtures to Kannena, made him many promises,
and threw over his shoulders a six-feet length of
scarlet broadcloth, which made him tremble with joy.
I ultimately secured two large canoes and fifty-five men.</p>

<p><!--Page 155-->
On April 12th my canoe, bearing for the first
time the British flag, stood out of Bangwe Bay, and,
followed by my companion in another canoe, we
made for the cloudy and storm-vexed north. There
were great rejoicings at our arrival at Uvira, the
northernmost station to which merchants had at that
time been admitted. Opposite still, rose in a high,
broken line the mountains of the inhospitable Urundi,
apparently prolonged beyond the northern extremity
of the waters. The breadth of the Tanganyika here
is between seven and eight miles. Now my hopes
were dashed to the ground; the stalwart sons of
the chief Maruta visited me, and told me that they
had been to the northern extremity, and that the
Rusizi enters into, and does not flow out of, the
Tanganyika. I was sick at heart. It appears that
my companion had misunderstood, and our guide
now told us that he had never been beyond Uvira,
and never intended to go; so we stopped here nine
days, and I got such a bad ulceration of the tongue
that I could not speak. The chiefs came and claimed
their blackmail, and also Kannena, so I had to pay
up all for nothing, as the gales began to threaten, and
our crews insisted on putting to lake on May 6th.</p>

<p>We touched at various stages about the lake, and
anchored at Mzimu, but we left again at sunset;
the waves began to rise, the wind also, and it rained
in torrents. It was a doubt whether the cockleshell
craft could live through a short, choppy sea in heavy
weather. I sheltered myself in my mackintosh as best
<!--Page 156-->
I might. Fortunately the rain beat down the wind
and the sea, or nothing could have saved us. The
next morning Mabruki rushed into my tent, thrust
a sword into my hands, and declared the Warundi
were upon us, and that the crews were rushing to
the boats and pushing them off. Knowing that they
would leave us stranded in case of danger, we hurried
in without delay; but no enemy appeared. It was
a false alarm.</p>

<p>On May 11th we paddled about a grassy inlet; on
the 12th we paddled again, and the next day we spent
in Bangwe Bay. We were too proud to sneak home
in the dark; we had done the expedition, and we
wanted to be looked at by the fair and howled at
by the valiant.</p>

<p>The next morning we appeared at the entrance of
Kawele, and had a triumphal entrance. The people
of the whole country-side assembled to welcome us,
and pressed waist-deep into the water. My companion
and I were repeatedly called for, but true merit is
always modest. We regained our old tembe, were
salaamed to by everybody, and it felt like a return
home. The upshot of it all was this&mdash;&#8203;we had expended
upwards of a month exploring the Tanganyika
Lake.</p>

<p>I had explored it thoroughly. My health now
began to improve, my strength increased; my feet
were still swollen, but my hands lost their numbness,
and I could again read and write. A relieved mind
had helped on this recovery&mdash;&#8203;the object of my expedition
<!--Page 157-->
was now effected&mdash;&#8203;and I threw off the burden of
grinding care with which the prospect of a probable
failure had sorely laden me.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The rainy monsoon broke up after our return to
Kawele, and the climate became most enjoyable, but
it was accompanied by that inexplicable melancholy
peculiar to tropical countries. I have never felt this
sadness in Egypt and Arabia, but I was never without
it in India and Zanzibar. We were expecting stores
and provisions, but we got not one single word from
the agents who were to forward our things, and want
began to stare us in the face. Money was a necessity,
or its equivalent. I had to engage porters for the
hammocks, feed seventy-five mouths, to fee several
chieftains, and to incur the heavy expenses of two hundred
and sixty miles’ marching back to Unyamyembe,
so I had to supplement the sum allowed me by
the Royal Geographical Society with my own little
patrimony. One thousand pounds does not go very
far when it has to be divided amongst two hundred
greedy savages in two and a half years.</p>

<p>On May 22nd our ears were gladdened by the
sound of musket-shots announcing arrivals, and then,
after a long silence of eleven months, there arrived
a caravan with boxes, bales, porters, slaves, and a
parcel of papers and letters from Europe, India, and
Zanzibar. How we pounced upon them! Here we
first knew of the Indian Mutiny. The caravan
<!--Page 158-->
arrived at a crisis when it was really wanted, but as
my agent could not find porters for all the packages,
he had kept back some of them, and what he sent
me were the least useful. They would suffice to
take us back to Unyamyembe, but were wholly inadequate
for exploring the southern end of Tanganyika,
far less for returning to Zanzibar <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> the Nyassa
Lake and Kilwa, as I had hoped to do.</p>

<p>On May 26th, 1858, we set out on our homeward
journey, and left Kawele <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for Unyamyembe.
I shall never forget my last sunrise look on
Tanganyika. The mists, luminously fringed with
purple, were cut by filmy rays; the living fire shot
forth broad beams over the light blue waters of the
lake, and a soft breeze, the breath of the morning,
awoke the waves into life.</p>

<p>I had great difficulties in getting away, but at nine
o’clock we departed with a full gang of porters, and
advanced until the evening. Many troubles arose:
a porter placed his burden upon the ground and
levanted, and being cognac and vinegar it was deeply
regretted; then the Unyamwezi guide, because his
newly purchased slave girl had become footsore and
unable to walk, cut her head off. All these disagreeables
I was obliged to smooth down as best I could.
Then there was a great dread of savage tribes, and
there was also a fear of conflagration, a sort of prairie
fire.</p>

<p>A sheet of flame, beginning with the size of a spark,
would overspread the hillside, advancing on the wings
<!--Page 159-->
of the wind with the roaring, rushing sound of many
hosts, where the grass was thick, shooting huge forked
tongues high into the air, and tall trees, the patriarchs
of the forest, yielded their lives to the blast. Onward
the fire would sweep, smouldering and darkening where
the rock afforded scanty fuel, then flickering, blazing
up, and soaring on again over the brow of the hill,
until the sheet became a thin line of fire, gradually
vanishing from the view.</p>

<p>On October 4th, after a week of halts and snails’
marches, we at last reached Hanga, our former quarters
in the western confines of the Unyamyembe district.
Here my companion was taken seriously ill, and
immediately after our arrival at this foul village, where
we were lodged in a sort of cow-house, full of vermin
and exposed directly to the fury of the cold gales, he
complained, in addition to the deaf ear, an inflamed
eye, and a swollen face, of a mysterious pain, which he
knew not whether to attribute to the liver or the
spleen. Shortly after this his mind began to wander,
and then he underwent three fits of an epileptic
description, which more closely resembled those of
hydrophobia than any I have ever witnessed. He was
haunted by a crowd of hideous devils, giants, and lion-headed
demons, who were wrenching and stripping the
sinews and tendons of his legs. He began to utter a
barking noise, with a peculiar chopping motion of the
mouth and tongue. When the third spasm was over,
he called for pen and paper, and, fearing that increased
weakness of mind and body might prevent any further
<!--Page 160-->
exertion, he wrote an incoherent letter of farewell to
his family. That, however, was the crisis, and he
afterwards spent a better night; the pains were
mitigated, or, as he expressed it, “the knives were
sheathed.”</p>

<p>As we were threatened with want of water on the
way, I prepared for that difficulty by packing a box
with empty bottles, which, when occasion required,
might be filled at the springs. The zemzemiyah, or
travelling canteen of the East African, was everywhere
a long-necked gourd, slung to the shoulder by a string.
But it became offensive after some use, and could never
be entrusted to a servant for a mile before its contents
were exhausted.</p>

<p>We left Hanga, my companion being now better,
on October 13th. Seven short marches between that
place and Tura occupied fifteen days, a serious waste
of time, caused by the craving of the porters for their
homes.</p>

<p>The stages now appeared shorter, the sun cooler,
the breeze warmer, for, after fourteen months of
incessant fevers, we had become tolerably acclimatised;
we were now loud in praise, as we had been in censure,
of the water and air. Before re-entering the Fiery
Field the hire for carrying hammocks became so exorbitant
that I dismissed the bearers, drew on my jackboots,
mounted the Zanzibar ass, and appeared once
more as the mtongi of a caravan. My companion was
also now able to ride.</p>

<p>At Eastern Tura, where we arrived on October 28th,
<!--Page 161-->
a halt was occasioned by the necessity of providing
and preparing food for the week’s march through the
Fiery Field. The caravan was then mustered, and it
completed altogether a party of one hundred and
fifty-two souls.</p>

<p>On November 3rd the caravan, issuing from Tura,
plunged manfully into the Fiery Field, and after seven
marches in as many days&mdash;&#8203;we halted for breath and
forage at the Round Stone&mdash;&#8203;Jiwe la Mkoa. Here
we procured a few rations, and resumed our way on
November 12th, and in two days exchanged, with a
sensible pleasure, the dull expanse of dry brown bush
and brushwood for the fertile red plain of Mdaburn.
At that point began our re-transit of Ugogo, where I
had been taught to expect accidents; they resolved
themselves into nothing more than the disappearance
of cloth and beads in inordinate quantities. The
Wanyamwezi porters seemed even more timid on the
down journey than on the up march. They slank
about like curs, and the fierce look of a Mgogo boy
was enough to strike terror into their hearts. One of
them would frequently indulge me in a dialogue like
the following, which may serve as a specimen of our
conversation in East Africa:&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p>“The state, Mdula?” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, Abdullah, a word unpronounceable
to negroid organs).</p>

<p>“The state is very! (well), and thy state?”</p>

<p>“The state is very! (well), and the state of
Spikka?” (my companion).</p>

<p>“The state of Spikka is very! (well).”</p>

<p><!--Page 162-->
“We have escaped the Wagogo, white man O!”</p>

<p>“We have escaped, O my brother!”</p>

<p>“The Wagogo are bad!”</p>

<p>“They are bad!”</p>

<p>“The Wagogo are very bad!”</p>

<p>“They are very bad!”</p>

<p>“The Wagogo are not good!”</p>

<p>“They are not good!”</p>

<p>“The Wagogo are not at all good!”</p>

<p>“They are not at all good!”</p>

<p>“I greatly feared the Wagogo, who killed the
Wanyamwezi!”</p>

<p>“Exactly so!”</p>

<p>“But now I don’t fear them. I call them &mdash;&mdash;&#8203;s and
&mdash;&mdash;&#8203;s, and I would fight the whole tribe, white
man O!”</p>

<p>“Truly so, O my brother!”</p>

<p>And so on for two mortal hours.</p>

<p>The transit of Ugogo occupied three weeks, from
November 14th to December 5th. In Kanyenye
we were joined by a large caravan of Wanyamwezi,
carrying ivories. On December 6th we arrived
at a halting place in the Ugogi Dhun, and were
greeted by another caravan, freshly arrived, commanded
by Hindus, who, after receiving and returning
news with much solemnity, presently drew forth a
packet of papers and letters, which as usual promised
trouble, and the inevitable&mdash;&#8203;to me&mdash;&#8203;“official
wigging.” I also received the following pleasant
letter:--</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="unindent"><!--Page 163--><span class="sc">Dear Burton</span>,</p>

<p class="">Go ahead! Vogel and Macguire dead&mdash;&#8203;murdered. Write
often to</p>

<p class="sigright">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="flushright">N.S.</p>
</div><!--end blockquote-->

<p>At Ugogo, which, it will be remembered, is considered
the half-way station between Unyamyembe and the
coast, we were detained a day through difficulties with
porters, who declared there was a famine upon the
road we had previously traversed, and also that a
great chief, who was also a great extortioner, was
likely to insist upon our calling upon him in person,
which would involve a change of route. However,
there was nothing to be done but to take the road.
We loaded on December 7th, and began the passage
of the Usagara Mountains, going this time by the
Kiringawana route.</p>

<p>Travelling by a roundabout way, we arrived at
the village of the chief Kiringawana on December
19th, and the next day proceeded to palaver. After
abundant chaffering, the chief accepted from the
expedition three expensive coloured cloths and other
things, grumbling the while because we had neglected
to reserve for him something more worthy his acceptance;
he returned a fat bullock, which was instantly
shot and devoured.</p>

<p>We resumed our march on December 22nd, which
was almost entirely down-hill. We crossed in a
blazing sun the fœtid plain, and after finding with
some difficulty the jungly path, we struck into a
<!--Page 164-->
pleasant forest. Presently we emerged again upon
the extremity of the Makata Plain, a hideous low
level of black vegetable earth, peaty in appearance,
and bearing long puddles of dark and stagnant rain-water&mdash;&#8203;mere
horse-ponds, with the additional qualities
of miasma and mosquitoes. The transit of this plain
took some days.</p>

<p>The dawn of Christmas Day, 1858, saw us toiling
along the Kikoboga River, which we forded four
times. The road presently turned up a rough rise,
from whose crest began the descent of the Mabruki
Pass. The descent was very steep and rough; the
path, spanning rough ground at the hill base, led us
to the plains of Uziraha in K’hutu.</p>

<p>We had reserved a bullock in honour of Christmas
Day, but as he was lost, I ordered the purchase of
half a dozen goats to celebrate it, but the porters
were too lazy to collect them. My companion and
I made good cheer upon a fat capon, which acted as
roast beef, with a mess of ground-nuts sweetened with
sugar-cane, which did duty as plum-pudding.</p>

<p>We started off again and entered Zungomero on
December 29th. An army of black musketeers, in
scanty but various and gaudy attire, came out to
meet us, and with the usual shots and shouts conducted
us to the headman’s house. They then stared
at us, as usual, for half a dozen consecutive hours,
which done, they retired to rest.</p>

<p>We stayed at Zungomero some time and celebrated
the New Year there, but January 21st, 1859, enabled
<!--Page 165-->
us to bid it adieu and merrily take to the footpath
way. We made Konduchi on February 3rd, after
twelve marches, which we accomplished in fourteen
days. There is little of interest or adventure to
record in this return line, for we travelled over much
the same ground we had done before.</p>

<p>As the mud near Dut’humi was throat-deep, we
crossed it lower down&mdash;&#8203;a weary trudge of several
miles through thick, slabby mire, which admitted a
man to his knees. In places, after toiling under a
sickly sun, we crept under tunnels of thick jungle
growth, the dank and fœtid cold causing a deadly
sensation of faintness, which was only relieved by
the glass of æther sherbet, a pipe or two of the
strongest tobacco, and half an hour’s rest.</p>

<p>On January 30th our natives of Zanzibar screamed
with delight at the sight of the monkey-tree,
an old, familiar sight to them. On February 2nd
we greeted, with doffed caps, and with three times
three and one more, as Britons will do on such
occasions, the kindly, smiling face of our father
Neptune as he lay basking in the sunbeams between
earth and air. February 3rd saw us winding
through the poles decorated with skulls&mdash;&#8203;a sort of
negro Temple Bar&mdash;&#8203;which pointed out the way into
the little village of Konduchi.</p>

<p>Our return was attended with much ceremony: the
war-men danced, shot, and shouted; a rabble of
adults, youths, and boys crowded upon us; the fair
sex lulliloo’d with vigour; and a general procession
<!--Page 166-->
conducted us to a hut, swept, cleaned, and garnished
for us by the principal banyan of the village, and there
they laughed and stared at us until they could laugh
and stare no more.</p>

<p>We were detained at Konduchi for some days, and
on February 9th the battela and the stores required
for our trip arrived from Zanzibar, and the next
day saw us rolling down the coast towards the Island
of Zanzibar, where we landed on March 4th, 1859.
I was taken ill there, and my companion went home
alone&mdash;&#8203;thereby hangs a tale. But I recovered after
a while, and left Zanzibar for Aden to catch the
homeward boat. I bade adieu to the “coal-hole of
the East” on April 28th, 1859, and in due time
arrived once more on the shores of Old England,
after an absence of two years and eight months.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent dropcap">I &thinsp;HAD long determined to add the last new name&mdash;&#8203;Great
Salt Lake City&mdash;&#8203;to my list of Holy Cities;
to visit the new rival, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i>, of Memphis, Benares,
Jerusalem, Rome, and Meccah; and to observe the
origin and working of a regular go-ahead Western
revelation. Mingled with the wish of prospecting
the city of the Mormons from a spiritual point of
view was the mundane desire of enjoying a little
skirmishing with the savages, who had lately been
giving the “pale-faces” tough work to do.</p>

<p>The man was ready, the hour hardly appeared propitious
for other than belligerent purposes. Throughout
the summer of 1860 an Indian war was raging
in Nebraska; the Comanches, Kiowas, and Cheyennes
were “out”; the Federal Government had despatched
three columns to the centres of confusion; intestine
feuds amongst the aborigines were talked of; the
Dakota, or Sioux, had threatened to “wipe out”
their old foe the Pawnee. Both tribes were possessors
of the soil over which the road to Great
Salt Lake City ran. Horrible accounts of murdered
post-boys and cannibal emigrants, grossly exaggerated
<!--Page 170-->
as usual, filled the papers. “Going amongst the
Mormons!” said a friend to me at New Orleans.
“They are shooting and cutting one another in all
directions. How can <em>you</em> expect to escape?” But
sagely reflecting that “dangers which loom large from
afar generally lose size as one draws near,” and that
even the Mormons might turn out less black than
they were painted, I resolved to run the risk of the
“red nightcap” from the bloodthirsty Indians and
the poisoned bowie-dagger from the jealous Latter-Day
Saints. I therefore applied myself to then
audacious task of an expedition to the City of the
Mormons.</p>

<p>There were three roads to be chosen from&mdash;&#8203;the
three main lines, perhaps, for a Pacific railway between
the Mississippi and the Western Ocean&mdash;&#8203;the northern,
the central, and the southern. The first, or British,
was not to be thought of, since it involved semi-starvation,
a possible plundering by the Bedouins, and,
what was far worse, five or six months of slow travel.
The third, or southern, took twenty-four days and
nights, and the journey was accompanied by excessive
heat in a malarial climate, to say nothing of poisonous
food. There remained only the central road, which
has two branches; of these I chose the great emigrant
road from Missouri to California. The mail coach
on this line was not what one would call luxurious,
and the hours of halting-places were badly selected.
The schedule time from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph, Missouri, to Great
Salt Lake City was twenty-one days; we accomplished
<!--Page 171-->
it, it turned out, in nineteen. I therefore travelled
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph, disrespectfully known as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jo, bought
my ticket, and prepared to start.</p>

<p>An important part in my preparations was the kit,
which in my case was represented as follows:&mdash;&#8203;One
India-rubber blanket, pierced in the centre for a poncho,
and with buttons and elastic loops, which converted
it into a carpet bag. I ought to have added a
buffalo robe as a bed, but ignorance prevented. With
one’s coat as a pillow, a buffalo robe, and a blanket,
one might defy the dangerous “bunks” of the stations.
For weapons I carried two revolvers. In those days,
from the moment of leaving <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph to the time
of reaching Placerville or Sacramento, the pistol ought
never to be absent from a man’s right hand, nor the
bowie-knife from his left. Contingencies with Indians
and others might happen, when the difference of an
instant might save life. In dangerous places the revolver
should be discharged and loaded every morning, both
for the purpose of keeping the hand in and doing
the weapon justice. A revolver is an admirable tool
when properly used. Those, however, who are too
idle or careless to attend to it had better carry a pair
of “Derringers.” I took also some opium, which is
invaluable on the prairie, and some other drugs against
fever. The “holy weed, Nicotian,” was not forgotten,
for cigars were most useful, as the driver either
received or took the lion’s share. The prairie
traveller was not very particular about his clothes;
the easiest dress was a dark flannel shirt, worn over
<!--Page 172-->
the normal article, no braces, but a broad leather belt
for a six-shooter and a “Kansas tooth-pick,” a long
clasp-knife. The nether garments were forked with
good buckskin, or they would infallibly have given
out, and the lower ends were tucked into the boots,
after the sensible fashion of our grandfathers. In
cold weather&mdash;&#8203;the nights were rarely warm&mdash;&#8203;there was
nothing better than an old English shooting-jacket;
for riding or driving a large pair of buckskin gloves,
or rather gauntlets, were advisable, and we did not
forget spurs. The best hat was a brown felt, which,
by boring holes around the brim to admit a ribbon,
could be converted into a riding-hat or a nightcap,
as you pleased. Having got my kit and purchased
my ticket, I was ready to start.</p>

<p>Precisely at 8 a.m. on Tuesday, August 7th, 1860,
there appeared in front of the Patee House, the Fifth
Avenue Hotel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph, the vehicle destined to
be my home for the next three weeks. I scrutinised
it curiously. It was what was known as a “concord
coach,” a spring waggon, of which the body is shaped
something like an English tax-cart considerably magnified.
It paid no regard to appearances, but was safe,
strong, and light. The wheels were five to six feet
apart, affording security against capsizing; the tyres
were of unusual thickness, and polished like steel by
the hard, dry ground. The waggon bed was supported
by iron bands, and the whole bed was covered with
stout osnaburg, supported by strong bars of white
oak. There was a sunshade, or hood, in front where
<!--Page 173-->
the driver sat, a curtain behind, which could be raised
or lowered at discretion, and four flaps on each side,
either folded up, or fastened down with hooks and
eyes. The coach was drawn by a team of four mules,
which were much preferred to horses as being more
enduring. The rate of travel, on an average, was five
miles an hour. This was good; between seven and
eight was the maximum, which sank in hilly country
to three or four.</p>

<p>We were detained more than an hour before we
started. Our “plunder,” as they called the luggage,
was clapped on with little ceremony, and when all
was packed away (and a good deal of the comfort of
the journey depended on the packing), we rattled
through the dusty roads of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jo, got on the steam
ferry, which conveyed us from the right to the left
bank of the Missouri River, and landed us in
“bleeding” Kansas. We then fell at once into the
emigrant road, as it was called, to the Far West, a
great thoroughfare at this point, open, broad, and
well worn as a European turnpike or a Roman military
road, and undoubtedly the best and longest natural
highway in the world.</p>

<p>At first the scene was one of a luxuriant vegetation;
but after an hour of burning sun and sickly damp,
the effects of the late storms, we emerged from the
waste of vegetation on to the region of the Grand
Prairie. Over the rolling surface, which rarely broke
into hill or dale, lay a tapestry of thick grass, already
turning to a ruddy yellow under the influence of
<!--Page 174-->
approaching autumn. Nothing, I may remark, is more
monotonous, except the African and Indian jungle,
than these prairie tracks. You saw, as it were, the
ends of the earth, and looked around in vain for
some object upon which the eye might rest; it wanted
the sublimity of repose so suggestive in the sandy
deserts, and the perpetual motion so pleasing in the
aspect of the sea.</p>

<p>Passing through a few wretched shanties called Troy,
in Syracuse, we arrived about three o’clock at Cold
Springs, where we were allowed an hour’s halt to
dine and change mules. The scene was the “rale”
Far West. The widow body to whom the shanty of
the station belonged lay sick with fever, and the aspect
of her family was a “caution to snakes.” The ill-conditioned
sons dawdled about, listless as Indians,
in skin tunics, and the daughters, whose sole attire
was apparently a calico morning wrapper, waited on
us in a grudging way in the wretched log hut, which
appeared ignorant of the duster and the broom.
Myriads of flies disputed with us a dinner consisting
of dough-nuts, suspicious eggs in a greasy fritter, and
rusty bacon, intolerably fat. It was our first sight of
squatter life, and, except in two cases, it was our worst.</p>

<p>We drove on all the afternoon and all the night,
except for a halt for supper. The last part of our
journey was performed under a heavy thunderstorm.
Gusts of violent wind whizzed overhead, thunder
crashed and rattled, and vivid lightning, flashing out
of the murky depths around, made earth and air
<!--Page 175-->
one blaze of fire. We arrived about one o’clock a.m.
at Locknan’s station, a few log huts near a creek.
Here we found beds and snatched an hour of sleep.
So passed the first day.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to describe the journey day
by day, for it lasted nineteen days, and one day was
often much like another. I shall therefore content
myself with picking out the chief points of interest
on the route.</p>

<p>Before long the prairies wore a burnt-up aspect.
As far as the eye could see the tintage was that of
the Arabian desert. It was still, however, too early
for prairie fires, and I therefore did not witness this
magnificent spectacle. In some parts, where the grass
is tall and rank, and the roaring flames leap before
the fire with the stride of a maddened horse, the
danger is imminent, and the spectacle must be one
of awful sublimity.</p>

<p>I said at first that the prairie scenery was monotonous,
and so on the whole it was, but every now and then
we came upon beautiful oases in the desert. Such
was the valley of the Little Blue River, fringed with
emerald-green oak groves, cotton wood, and long-leaved
willow. As we got on to the tableland above
this river, between that and the River Platte, the
evening approached, and a smile from above lit up
into perfect beauty the features of the world below.
It was a glorious sunset. Stratum upon stratum of
cloud banks, burnished to golden red in the vicinity of
the setting sun, and polished to dazzling silvery white
<!--Page 176-->
above, lay piled half-way from the horizon to the
zenith, with a distinct strike towards a vanishing
point to the west and dipping into a gateway, through
which the orb of day slowly retired. Overhead floated,
in a sea of amber and yellow, pink and green heavy
purple clouds, whilst in the east black and blue were
so curiously blended that the eye could not distinguish
whether it rested upon a darkening air or a lowering
thunder-cloud. We enjoyed these beauties, I am glad
to say, in silence; not a soul said “Look there!” or
“How pretty!”</p>

<p>When we came to the fork of the great River
Platte we saw from time to time a line of Indian
removes. This meant that these wild people were
shifting their quarters for grass, and when it became
a little colder they sought some winter abode on
the banks of a stream which supplied fuel and where
they could find meat, so that with warmth and food,
song and talk, and smoke and sleep, they could while
away the dull and dreary winter.</p>

<p>The remove of an Indian village presented an
interesting sight. The animated and shifting scene
of bucks and braves, squaws and papooses, ponies
dwarfed by bad breeding and hard living, dogs and
puppies&mdash;&#8203;all straggled over the plains westward. In
front, singly or in pairs, rode the men, as if born
upon, and bred to become part of, the animal; some
went bare-backed, others rode upon a saddle tree.
In some cases the saddle was trimmed with bead
hangings. Their long, lank, thick, brownish-black
<!--Page 177-->
hair, ruddy from the effects of the weather, was worn
parted in the middle. This parting in men, as well
as in women, was generally coloured with vermilion,
and plates of brass or tin were inserted into the
front hair. They wore many ornaments, and the
body dress was a tight-sleeved waistcoat over an
American cotton shirt, scarlet and blue being the
colours preferred. The garb ended with buckskin
leggings and moccasins. The braves were armed
with small tomahawks, or iron hatchets, which they
carried with the powder horn in the belt on the right
side. Their nags were lean and ungroomed. They
treat them as cruelly as do the Somali, yet nothing&mdash;&#8203;short
of whiskey&mdash;&#8203;could persuade an Indian warrior
to part with his favourite steed. Behind the warriors
and the braves followed the baggage of the village.
The rich squaws rode in litters, the poorer followed
their pack-horses on foot. Their garb did not a little
resemble their lords, and I saw no great beauty among
them, young or old, rich or poor. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La belle savage</i> of
the party had large and languishing eyes, dentists’
teeth that glittered, and silky, long, black hair like
the ears of a Blenheim spaniel. Her ears and neck
were laden with tinsel ornaments, and she was very
finely dressed. There was with the cavalcade a great
company of boys and girls.</p>

<p>On the sixth day we crossed the Platte. We had
spent most of the night in the waggon, most uncomfortably.
At 3.15 a.m., hungry and thirsty, and by no
means in the best of humours, we heard with joy the
<!--Page 178-->
savage “Yep, yep, yep,” with which the driver was
wont to announce our approach to a station. Presently
the plank lodging appeared through the darkness.
We sprang out of the ambulance; but all was dark
and silent as the grave: the station was asleep. A
heavy kick opened the door of the restaurant, when a
wheezy, drowsy voice from an inner room asked us in
German-English, “And how ze komen in?” Without
waiting to answer we pulled the owner of it out
of bed, and ordered supper, refreshment, and repose.
But he raised all sorts of difficulties, and it ended with
our sitting down and staring at the fire and waiting
for the vile food which he provided for our breakfast.
I should like here to describe an ordinary prairie breakfast,
the one which greeted us nearly all through our
journey. First, the coffee, three parts burnt beans,
which had been duly ground to a fine powder and
exposed to the air lest the aroma should prove too
strong for us. It was placed on the stove to simmer,
till every noxious principle was duly extracted from
it. Then the rusty bacon, cut into thick slices, was
thrust into the frying-pan; here the gridiron was
unknown. Thirdly, antelope steak, cut off a carcase
suspended for the benefit of flies outside was placed
to stew within influence of the bacon’s aroma. Lastly
came the bread, which, of course, should have been
cooked first. The meal was kneaded with water and
a pinch of salt; the raising was done by means of a
little sour malt, or more generally by the deleterious
yeast powders of the trade. The dough, after having
<!--Page 179-->
been sufficiently manipulated, was divided into doughnuts,
or biscuits, and finally it was placed to be half-cooked
under the immediate influence of the rusty
bacon and rancid antelope. Uncle Sam’s stove was
a triumph of convenience, cheapness, unwholesomeness,
and nastiness. It made everything taste like its
neighbour; by virtue of it mutton borrowed the
flavour of fish, and tomatoes resolved themselves into
the flavour of greens.</p>

<p>One of the most notable points of our journey was
Scott’s Bluffs, the last of the great marl formations
which break the dull uniformity of the prairies. Before
we came to them we passed the far-famed Chimney
Rock, which lies two and a half miles from the south
bank of the Platte. Viewed from the south-east, it
was not unlike a gigantic jack-boot poised on a high
pyramidal mound; I took a sketch of it. Scott’s
Bluffs are far more striking and attractive objects;
indeed, they excel the Castle Craig of Drachenfels or
any of the beauties of the romantic Rhine. From the
distance of a day’s march they appeared in the shape
of a large blue mound. As you approached within
four or five miles, a massive mediæval city gradually
defined itself, clustering with wonderful fulness of
detail round a colossal fortress, and crowned with
a royal castle. It was indeed a beautiful castle on
the rock, and that nothing may be wanting to the
resemblance, the dashing rains and angry winds have
cut the old line of road at its base into a regular moat
with a semicircular sweep, which the mirage fills with
<!--Page 180-->
a mimic river. Quaint figures develop themselves,
guards and sentinels in dark armour keep watch and
ward upon the slopes, the lion of Bastia crouched unmistakably
overlooking the road, and, as the shades
of evening closed in, so weird was its aspect that one
might almost expect to see some spectral horseman go
his rounds about the broken walls. At a nearer aspect
the quaint illusion vanished, the lines of masonry
became great layers of boulder, curtains and angles
changed to the gnashing rents of ages, and the warriors
were transformed into dwarf cedars and dense shrubs.
Travellers have compared Scott’s Bluffs to Gibraltar,
to the Capitol at Washington, and to Stirling Castle; I
could think of nothing in its presence but the Arabs’
“City of Brass,” that mysterious abode of bewitched
infidels, which often appears to the wayfarer toiling
under the sun, but which for ever eludes his nearer
search.</p>

<p>On our last day in the Platte Valley, just before we
entered the Sioux territory, we came to Horseshoe
station, which was impressed upon my memory by one
thing, which I shall presently explain. We were
struck by the aspect of the buildings, which were
on an extensive scale; in fact, got up regardless of
expense. An immense silence, however, reigned. At
last, by hard knocking, we were admitted into a house
with a Floridan verandah. By the pretensions of the
room we were at once threatened with a “lady.”
Our mishap was really worse than we expected, for in
reality we were exposed to two “ladies,” and one of
<!--Page 181-->
these was a Bloomer. This, it is fair to state, was the
only hermaphrodite of the kind that ever met my eyes
in the States; the great founder of the Bloomer order
has long since subsided into her original obscurity,
and her acolytes have relapsed into petticoats. The
Bloomer was an uncouth being, her hair, cut level with
her eyes, depended with the graceful curl of a drake’s
tail around a fat and flabby countenance, whose only
expression was sullen insolence. Her body-dress,
glazed brown calico, fitted her somewhat like a soldier’s
tunic, developing haunches which would be admired
only in venison; and&mdash;&#8203;curious inconsequence of
woman’s nature!&mdash;&#8203;all this sacrifice of appearance upon
the shrine of comfort did not prevent her wearing that
kind of crinoline depicted by Mr. <em>Punch</em> around “our
Mary Hanne.” The pantolettes of glazed brown
calico, like the vest, tunic, blouse, shirt, or whatever
they may call it, were in peg-top style, admirably
setting off a pair of thin-soled, Frenchified, patent-leather
bottines, with elastic sides, which contained feet
as large, broad, and flat as a negro’s in Africa. The
dear creature had a husband: it was hardly safe to
look at her, and as for sketching her, I avoided it.
The other “lady,” though more decently attired, was
like women in this wild part of the world generally&mdash;&#8203;cold
and disagreeable, with a touch-me-not air, which
reminded me of a certain</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i6">Miss Baxter,</div>
<div class="i0">Who refused a man before he axed her.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Her husband was the renowned Slade, who had the
<!--Page 182-->
reputation of having killed his three men. This
pleasant individual “for an evening party” wore a
revolver and bowie-knife here, there, and everywhere.
It at once became evident that this station was not
conducted for the public convenience. One of our
party who had ventured into the kitchen was fiercely
ejected by the “ladies,” and, asking for dormitories,
we were informed that lady travellers were admitted
into the house, but men could sleep where they could.
We found a barn outside; it was hardly fit for a
decently brought up pig: the floor was damp and
knotty; there was not even a door to keep out the
night breeze; and several drunken fellows lay about
in different parts of it. Into this disreputable hole
we were all thrust for the night. “May gracious
Heaven,” I prayed, “keep us safe from all ‘ladies’ in
future!” Better a hundred times the squaw, with her
uncleanliness and her civility!</p>

<p>It was about the tenth day of our journey that the
formation of the land began to warn us that we were
approaching, as yet far off, the Rocky Mountains.
We saw for the first time a train of Mormon waggons,
twenty-four in number, slowly wending their way
towards the Promised Land. The “captain” was
young Brigham Young, a nephew of the Prophet&mdash;&#8203;a
fine fellow, with yellow hair and beard, an intelligent
countenance, a six-shooter by his right, and a bowie-knife
by his left side. It was impossible to mistake,
even through the veil of freckles and sunburn with
which a two months’ journey had invested them, the
<!--Page 183-->
nationality of these emigrants&mdash;&#8203;“British-English” was
written all over them. One young person concealed
her facial attractions under a manner of mask.
I though that perhaps she might be a sultana, reserved
for the establishment of some very magnificent
Mormon bashaw; but the driver, when appealed to,
responded with contempt, “’Guess old Briggy won’t
stampede many o’ that ere lot!” Though homely
in appearance, they seemed to be healthy and well fed.</p>

<p>The same day, a little later, we crossed a war party
of Arapahos; they looked less like warriors than a
band of horse-stealers, and though they had set out
with the determination of bringing back some Utah
scalps and fingers, they had not succeeded. The war
party consisted of some dozen warriors, with a few
limber, lithe lads. They had sundry lean, sorry-looking
nags, which were presently turned out to
graze. Dirty rags formed the dress of the band;
their arms were the usual light lances, garnished with
leather at the handles, with two cropped tufts and a
long loose feather dangling from them. They carried
mangy buffalo robes; and scattered upon the ground
was a variety of belts, baldricks, and pouches, with
split porcupine quills dyed a saffron yellow. I found
them sulky and not disposed to be communicative, a
fact which, no doubt, was accounted for by the ill-success
of their expedition.</p>

<p>I have given some account of the “ladies” we
met <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>; in fairness one must reverse the shield,
for, at a station forbiddingly known as the Devil’s
<!--Page 184-->
Post-Office, we came across an Englishwoman, a
“Miss” Moore (Miss is still used for Mrs. by Western
men and negroes), who was a pattern of cleanliness,
tidiness, civility, and housewifery in general. Her
little ranche was neatly swept and garnished, papered
and ornamented. The table-cloth was clean, so was
the cooking, and so were the children, and I was
reminded of Europe by the way in which she insisted
upon washing my shirt, an operation which, after
leaving the Missouri, had fallen to my own lot. This
day also introduced me to the third novel sensation
on the western side of the Atlantic. The first was
to feel that all men were your equal; that you were
no man’s superior, and that no man was yours. The
second&mdash;&#8203;this is spoken as an African wanderer&mdash;&#8203;was to
see one’s quondam acquaintance, the Kaffir or Negro,
put by his grass kilt and coat of grease, invest himself
in broadcloth, part his wool on one side, shave, and call
himself, not Sambo, but “Mr. Scott.” The third
was to meet in the Rocky Mountains with this
woman, a refreshing specimen of that far-off Old
World. “Miss” Moore’s husband, a decent appendage,
had transferred his belief from the Church of
England to the Church of Utah, and the good wife,
as in duty bound, had followed in his wake. But
when the Serpent came and whispered in “Miss”
Moore’s modest, respectable, one-idea’d ear that the
Abrahams of Great Salt Lake City were mere
“Shamabrams,” and not content with Sarahs, but
added to them an unlimited supply of Hagars, her
<!--Page 185-->
power of endurance broke down. Not an inch would
she budge, not a step nearer to the City of the Saints
would she take. She fought against the impending
misfortune, and she succeeded in reducing her husband
to submission and making him earn a good livelihood
as station-master on the waggon-line&mdash;&#8203;he who might
have been a Solomon in the City of the Saints!</p>

<p>The evening of the next day, when we had
reached Pacific Springs, the Wind River Mountains
appeared in marvellous majesty. It was one of the
sights of the journey. The huge purple hangings
of rain-clouds in the northern sky set off their vast
proportions, and gave prominence, as in a stereoscope,
to their gigantic forms and their upper heights, hoar
with the frosts of ages. The setting sun diffused
a charming softness over their more rugged features,
defining the folds and ravines with a distinctness
which deceived every idea of distance. As the light
sank beyond the far western horizon it travelled
slowly up the mountain side, till, reaching the summit,
it mingled its splendours with the snow. Nor was
the scene less lovely in the morning hour, as the
first effulgence of day fell upon the masses of dew-cloud,
lit up the peaks, which gleamed like silver,
and poured streams of light and warmth over the
broad skirts reposing on the plain.</p>

<p>On August 25th, the nineteenth day of our journey,
we set out at 7 a.m. to breast the Wasach, the last
and highest chain of the mountain mass before we
reached Great Salt Lake Valley, and to arrive at our
<!--Page 186-->
destination&mdash;&#8203;the New Jerusalem, the future Zion on
the tops of the mountains. The road up the big
mountain was a very rough one, lined on either side
with great trees&mdash;&#8203;hemlocks, firs, and balsam-pines. The
varied hues of the quaking ash were there also; the
beech, dwarf oak, and thickets of elders and wild roses;
whilst over all the warm autumnal tints already
mingled with the bright green of summer. The ascent
became more and more rugged; this steep pitch,
at the end of a thousand miles of hard work and semi-starvation,
caused the death of many a wretched animal.
Towards the summit it rises sharpest. Here we
descended from the waggon, which the four mules
had work enough to draw. The big mountain lies
eighteen miles from the city; the top is a narrow
crest. From that eyrie, eight thousand feet above
sea-level, the weary pilgrim first sights his shrine,
the object of his long wanderings, hardships, and
perils&mdash;&#8203;the Happy Valley of the Great Salt Lake.</p>

<p>After a few minutes’ delay to stand and gaze, we
resumed the footpath way, whilst the mail-waggon,
with wheels rough-locked, descended what appeared
to be an impracticable slope. Falling into the gorge
of Big Kanyon Creek, we reached about midday a
station, half stifled by the thick dust and the sun.
We slaked our thirst with the cool water that trickled
down the hill by the house side. Presently the station-master
arrived; he was introduced to us as Mr. Eph
Hanks. I had often heard of him as a Mormon
desperado, leader of the dreaded Danite band, and
<!--Page 187-->
a model ruffian. We found him very pleasant and
sociable, though a facetious allusion to the dangers
that awaited us under the roof of the Danite was
made. We had dinner there, and, after a friendly
leave, we entered the mail-waggon again, and prepared
ourselves for the last climb over the western-most
reach of the Wasach.</p>

<p>The road was now only a narrow shelf, and frequent
fordings were rendered necessary by the capricious
wanderings of the torrent. At one of the most
ticklish turns our driver kindly pointed out a precipice
where four of the mail passengers fell and broke their
necks. He also entertained us with sundry other
horrible tales. In due time, emerging from the gates
and portals and deep serrations of the upper course,
we descended into a lower level, and the valley
presently lay full before our sight. At this place
the pilgrim emigrants, like the hajis of Jerusalem
and Meccah, were wont to give vent to the emotions
pent up in their bosoms by sobs and tears, laughter
and congratulations, psalms and hysterics. It is indeed
no wonder that children danced, that strong men
cheered and shouted, and that nervous women, broken
with fatigue and hope deferred, screamed and fainted;
that the ignorant fondly believed that the “Spirit of
God” pervaded the very atmosphere, and that Zion
on the tops of the mountains is nearer Heaven than
the other parts of the earth. In good sooth, though
uninfluenced by religious fervour&mdash;&#8203;beyond the natural
satisfaction of seeing a brand new Holy City&mdash;&#8203;even
<!--Page 188-->
I could not, after nineteen days of the mail-waggon,
gaze upon the scene without emotion.</p>

<p>The hour was about 6 p.m., the atmosphere was
touched with a dreamy haze, and a little bank of rose-coloured
clouds, edged with flames of purple and gold,
floated in the upper air, whilst the mellow radiance
of an American autumn diffused its mild, soft lustre
over the face of the earth. The sun was setting in
a flood of heavenly light behind the bold, jagged
outline of Antelope Island. At its feet, and then
bounding the far horizon, lay, like a band of burnished
silver, the Great Salt Lake, that innocent Dead Sea.
South-westwards, and the Oquirrh Range sharply
silhouetted against the depths of an evening sky.</p>

<p>The undulating valley-plain between us and the
Oquirrh Range, once a howling wilderness given
over to a few miserable savages, was now the site of
a populous city. Truly the Mormon prophecy had
been fulfilled; the desert had blossomed like the rose.</p>

<p>As we descended the Wasach Mountains we could
look and enjoy the view of the Happy Valley, and
the bench-land then attracted our attention. The
eastern valley-bench, upon whose western declivity
the city lies, may be traced on a clear day along the
base of the mountains for a distance of twenty
miles. As we advanced over the bench-ground,
the city by slow degrees broke upon our sight. It
showed, one may readily believe, to special advantage
after a succession of Indian lodges, Canadian ranchos,
and log-hut mail-stations of the prairies and the
<!--Page 189-->
mountains. About two miles north, and overlooking
the settlements from a height of four hundred feet,
a detached cone called Ensign Mount rose at the end
of a chain, and overhung and sheltered the north-eastern
corner of the valley. Upon this mount the spirit of
the martyred Prophet, Mr. Joseph Smith, is said to
have appeared to his successor, Mr. Brigham Young,
and pointed out to him the position of the new temple,
which, after Zion had “got up into the high mountain,”
was to console the saints for the loss of Nauvoo the
Beautiful.</p>

<p>The city was about two miles broad, running
parallel with the right bank of the Jordan, which
forms its western limit. As we approached, it lay
stretched before us as upon a map; at a little
distance the aspect was somewhat Oriental, and in some
points it reminded me of modern Athens&mdash;&#8203;without the
Acropolis. None of the buildings, except the Prophet’s
house, were whitewashed. The material, the thick,
sun-dried adobe, common to all parts of the Eastern
world, was here of a dull leaden blue, deepened by the
atmosphere to a grey, like the shingles of the roofs.
The number of gardens and compounds, the dark
clumps of cottonwood, locust, or acacia, fruit trees&mdash;&#8203;apples,
peaches and vines&mdash;&#8203;and, finally, the fields of
long-eared maize, strengthened the similarity to an
Asiatic rather than to an American settlement. But
the difference presently became as marked. Farm
houses strongly suggested the old country; moreover,
domes and minarets, even churches and steeples, were
<!--Page 190-->
wholly wanting. The only building conspicuous from
afar was the block occupied by the present Head
of the Church. The court-house, with its tinned,
Muscovian dome; the arsenal, a barn-like structure;
and a saw-mill were next in importance.</p>

<p>As we entered the suburbs, the houses were almost
all of one pattern, a barn shape, and the diminutive
casements showed that window glass was not yet made
in the valley. The poorer houses are small, low, and
hut-like; the others, single-storied buildings, somewhat
like stables, with many entrances. The best houses
resembled East Indian bungalows, with flat roofs and
low, shady verandahs, well trellised, and supported by
posts or pillars. I looked in vain for the outhouse-harems,
in which certain romancers concerning things
Mormon had told me that wives were kept, like other
stock. I presently found this one of a multitude of
delusions. The people came out to their doors to
see the mail-coach, as if it were a “Derby dilly” of
old, go by. I was struck by the English appearance
of the colony, and the prodigious numbers of white-headed
children.</p>

<p>Presently we turned into the main thoroughfare,
the centre of population and business, where the houses
of the principal Mormon dignitaries and the stores of
the Gentile merchants combined to form the city’s
only street, properly so called. We pulled up at the
Salt Lake House, the principal if not the only establishment
of the kind in New Zion. In the Far West one
learns not to expect much of a hostelry, and I had not
<!--Page 191-->
seen one so grand for many a day. It was a two-storied
building, with a long verandah supported by painted
posts. There was a large yard behind for coralling
cattle. A rough-looking crowd of drivers and their
friends and idlers, almost every man armed with
revolver and bowie-knife, gathered round the doorway
to prospect the “new lot.” The host presently came
out to assist us in carrying in our luggage. There
was no bar, but upstairs we found a Gentile ball-room,
a fair sitting-room, and bedchambers, apparently made
out of a single apartment by partitions too thin to
be strictly agreeable. The proprietor was a Mormon
who had married an Englishwoman. We found him
in the highest degree civil and obliging. To sum up,
notwithstanding some considerable drawbacks, my
first experience of the Holy City of the Far West was
decidedly better than I expected.</p>

<p>Our journey had occupied nineteen days, from
August 7th to 25th both included, and in that time
we had accomplished not less than 1,136 statute miles.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Before</span> giving any detailed account of the Mormons,
I should like to say that I was twenty-four days at
headquarters, and every opportunity was given me
of surface observation; but there is in Mormondom,
as in all other exclusive faiths, Jewish, Hindu, or other,
an inner life, into which I cannot flatter myself to
have penetrated. No Gentile, however long he may
live in Salt Lake City, or how intimately he may be
connected with the Mormons, can expect to see anything
but the outside. The different accounts which
have been given of life in the City of the Saints by
anti-Mormons and apostates are venomous and misleading,
whilst the writings of the faithful are necessarily
untrustworthy. I therefore take the middle
distance of the unprejudiced observer, and can only
recount, honestly and truthfully, what I heard, felt,
and saw.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival I went to see the
Governor, the Hon. Alfred Cumming, who had been
appointed by the President of the United States to
assume the supreme executive authority at Great Salt
Lake City. The conditions were that polygamy should
<!--Page 193-->
not be interfered with, nor forcible measures resorted
to, except in extremest need. Governor Cumming,
accompanied by his wife, with an escort of six hundred
dragoons, entered the city in the spring of 1858,
shortly after the Mormons were in open rebellion
against the Federal authority. By firmness, prudence,
and conciliation, he not only prevented any collision
between the local militia and the United States army,
but succeeded in restoring order and obedience
throughout the territory. He was told that his life
was in danger, and warned that he might share the
fate of Governor Boggs, who was shot through the
mouth when standing at the window. His answer
was to enlarge the casements of his house, in order
to give the shooters a fair chance. The impartiality
which he brought to bear in the discharge of his
difficult and delicate duties, and his resolution to
treat the saints like Gentiles and citizens, not as Digger
Indians or felons, had not, when I was at Great
Salt Lake City, won him the credit which he deserved
from either party. The anti-Mormons abused him,
and declared him to be a Mormon in Christian disguise;
the Mormons, though more moderate, could
never, by their very organisation, be content with
a temporal and extraneous power existing side by
side with a spiritual power. Governor Cumming did
not meet his predecessor, the ex-Governor, Brigham
Young, except on public duty. Mrs. Cumming
visited Mrs. Young and the houses of the principal
dignitaries, this being the only society in the place.
<!--Page 194-->
Amongst the Moslems a Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu could learn more of domestic life in a
week than a man could in a year. So it was among
the Mormons, and Mrs. Cumming’s knowledge far
exceeded all that I might ever hope to gain.</p>

<p>The leading feature of Great Salt Lake City was
Main, otherwise Whiskey, Street. This broadway
was 132 feet wide, including twenty sidewalks, and,
like the rest of the principal avenues, was planted
with locust and other trees. The whole city was
divided up into wide streets, and planted with trees.
The stores were far superior to the shops of an
English country town; the public buildings were few
and unimposing. I was disappointed with the Temple
block, the only place of public and general worship
in the city; when I was there it was unfinished, a
mere waste. The Tabernacle, the principal building,
required enlarging, and was quite unfitted for the
temple of a new faith. It seemed hardly in accordance
with the energy and devotedness of this new
religion that such a building should represent the
House of the Lord, while Mr. Brigham Young, the
Prophet, thinking of his own comfort before the glory
of God, was lodged, like Solomon of old, in what was
comparatively a palace. Near the Tabernacle was the
Endowment House, or place of great medicine. Many
rites took place here in secret that were carefully concealed
from Gentile eyes, and with a result that human
sacrifices were said to be performed within its walls.
Personally, I did not believe in these orgies; there
<!--Page 195-->
were probably ceremonies of the nature of masonic
rites. Gentiles declared that the ceremonies consisted
of a sort of miracle play, and a respectable judge was
popularly known as “The Devil,” because he was
supposed to play the part of the Father of Sin when
tempting Adam and Eve. It was said that baptism
by total immersion was performed, and the ceremony
occupied eleven or twelve hours, the neophyte, after
bathing, being anointed with oil, and dressed in clean
white garments, cap and shirt, of which the latter was
rarely removed.</p>

<p>On the Monday after my arrival a smoke-like
column towards the east announced that the emigrants
were crossing the bench-land, and the people hurried
from all sides to greet them. Of course, I went,
too, as the arrival of these emigrants, or rather
prilgrims, was one of the sights of the City of the
Saints. Presently the carts came. All the new arrivals
were in clean clothes, the men washed and shaved,
and the girls were singing hymns, habited in Sunday
dress. Except the very young and the very old,
the company of pilgrims did not trouble the waggons.
They marched through clouds of dust over the sandy
road leading to the town, accompanied by crowds,
some on foot, others on horseback, and a few in traps.
A score of youths of rather rowdy appearance were
mounted in all the tawdriness of Western trappings&mdash;&#8203;Rocky
Mountain hats, embroidered buckskin garments,
red flannel shirts, gigantic spurs, pistols and knives
stuck in red sashes with depending ends. By-and-by
<!--Page 196-->
the train of pilgrims reached the public square, and
here, before the invasion of the Federal army, the first
President used to make a point of honouring the
arrival of pilgrims by a greeting in person. Not so on
this occasion; indeed, it was whispered that Brigham
Young seldom left his house except for the Tabernacle,
and, despite his powerful will and high moral courage,
did not show the personal intrepidity of Mr. Joseph
Smith. He had guards at his gates, and never
appeared in public unattended by friends and followers,
who were, of course, armed. On this occasion the
place of Mr. Brigham Young was taken by President-Bishop
Hunter. Preceded by a brass band, and accompanied
by the City Marshal, the Bishop stood up in
his conveyance, and calling up the captains of companies,
shook hands with them, and proceeded forthwith to
business. In a short time arrangements were made
for the housing and employment of all who required
work, whether men or women. Everything was
conducted with decorum.</p>

<p>I mingled freely among the crowd, and was introduced
to many, whose names I did not remember.
Indeed, the nomenclature of the Mormons was apt to
be rather confusing, because, in order to distinguish
children of different mothers, it was usual to prefix the
maternal to the paternal parents’ name, suppressing
the Christian name altogether. Thus, for instance,
my sons, if I had any, by Miss Brown and Miss Jones
and Miss Robinson respectively, would call themselves
Brother Brown-Burton, Brother Jones-Burton, and
<!--Page 197-->
Brother Robinson-Burton. The saints, even the
highest dignitaries, waive the reverend and the
ridiculous esquire, that “title much in use among
vulgar people.” The Mormon pontiff and the
eminences around him are simply brother or mister.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En revanche</i>, amongst the crowd there are as many
colonels and majors, about ten being the proportion
to one captain, as in the days when Mrs. Trollope
set the Mississippi on fire. Sister is applied to women
of all ages, whether married or single.</p>

<p>Many of the pilgrims were English, who had crossed
over the plains, looking towards Mr. Brigham Young
and Great Salt Lake City much as Roman Catholics
regard the Pope and Rome. The arrangements
for their convoy appeared to have been admirable,
but many tales were told of mismangement. An
old but favourite illustration of the trials of inexperienced
travellers from the Mississippi to California
was as follows. A man rode up to a standing
waggon, and seeing a wretched-looking lad nursing a
starving baby, asked him what the matter might be:
“Wal now,” responded the youth, “guess I’m kinder
streakt&mdash;&#8203;ole dad’s drunk, ole marm’s in hy-sterics,
brother Jim be playing poker with two gamblers, sister
Sal’s down yonder a-courtin’ with an in-tire stranger,
this ’ere baby’s got the diaree, the team’s clean guv out,
the waggon’s broke down, it’s twenty miles to the
next water. I don’t care a damn if I never see
Californy!”</p>

<p>The dress of the fair sex in Great Salt Lake City
<!--Page 198-->
was somewhat peculiar. The article called in Cornwall
a “gowk,” in other parts of England a “cottage
bonnet,” was universally used, plus a long, thick veil
behind, which acts as a cape or shawl. A loose jacket
and a petticoat, mostly of calico or some inexpensive
stuff, made up all that was visible. The wealthier
ladies affected silks, especially black. Love of dress,
however, was as great among the sisters as in women
in any other part of the world; in fact, I noticed that
this essential is everywhere a pleasing foible, and the
semi-nude savage, the crinolined “civilisee,” the nun
and the quakeress, the sinner and the saint, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">biche</i>
and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande dame</i>, all meet for once in their lives
pretty much on a par and on the same ground.</p>

<p>The sisters of Great Salt Lake City&mdash;&#8203;at least, the
native ones&mdash;&#8203;were distinctly good-looking, with regular
features, lofty brow, clear complexion, long, silky
hair, and a bewitching soft smile. It would seem that
polygamy had agreed with them. The belle of the
city, so far as I could see, was a Miss Sally A&mdash;&mdash;&#8203;,
daughter of a judge. Strict Mormons, however, rather
wagged their heads at this pretty person. She was
supposed to prefer Gentile and heathenish society,
and it was whispered against her that she had actually
vowed never to marry a saint.</p>

<p>The City of the Saints was not a dull city. In
addition to the spiritual exercises, provision was also
made for physical pastimes. The Social Hall was the
usual scene of Mormon festivities, and here one
could see the beauty and fashion of Great Salt
<!--Page 199-->
Lake City <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en grande tenue</i>. Good amateur acting
took place here, and dancing seemed to be considered
a most edifying exercise. The Prophet danced, the
apostles danced, the bishops danced, the young and the
old danced. There is high authority for perseverance
in this practice: David danced, we are told, with
all his might; and Scipio, according to Seneca, was
wont thus to exercise his heroic limbs. The balls
at the Social Hall were highly select, and conducted
on an expensive scale; ten-dollar tickets admitted
one lady with one gentleman, and for all extra ladies
two dollars each had to be paid. Space was limited,
and many a Jacob was shorn of his glory by having
to appear with only Rachael in his train, and without
a following of Leahs, Zilpahs, and Bilhahs.</p>

<p>An account of one of these balls might be of
interest. The hall was tastefully decorated. At
four o’clock in the afternoon the Prophet entered,
and order was called. He ascended a kind of platform,
and, with uplifted hands, blessed those present.
He then descended to the boards and led off the
first cotillon. At 8 p.m. supper was served; dancing
was resumed with spirit; and finally the party ended
as it began, with prayer and benediction, about five
o’clock in the morning&mdash;&#8203;thirteen successive mortal
hours. I may mention that, in order to balance any
disparity of the sexes, each gentleman was allowed
to lead out two ladies and dance with them, either
together or alternately. What an advantage this
would be in many a London ball-room!</p>

<p><!--Page 200-->
I will now proceed to describe my visit to the
President, or Prophet, Brigham Young. Governor
Cumming had first written to ask if he would give
me the honour of an interview; and, having received
a gracious reply, I proceeded with him to call upon
the Prophet on August 31st, at 11 a.m., as appointed.
We arrived at the house, and, after a slight scrutiny,
passed the guard, and, walking down the verandah,
entered the Prophet’s private office. Several people
who were sitting there rose at Governor Cumming’s
entrance. At a few words of introduction, Brigham
Young advanced, shook hands with me, and invited
me to be seated on a sofa on one side of the room,
and presented me to those present.</p>

<p>The “President of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints all over the World” was born
at Whittingham, Vermont, on June 1st, 1801. He
was, consequently, at the time I saw him, in 1860,
fifty-nine years old; he looked about forty-five.
I had expected to see a venerable-looking old man;
but scarcely a grey thread appeared in his hair, which
was parted on the side, light-coloured, and rather
thick. His forehead was somewhat narrow, the eyebrows
thin, the eyes between grey and blue, with a
calm and somewhat reserved expression. A slight
droop in the left lid made me think he had suffered
from paralysis; I afterwards heard it was the result
of a neuralgia, which long tormented him. The
nose, which was fine and somewhat pointed, was
bent a little to the left; the lips were like the
<!--Page 201-->
New Englander’s, and the teeth were imperfect. The
cheeks were rather fleshy, the chin somewhat peaked,
and face clean-shaven, except under the jaws, where
the beard was allowed to grow. The hands were
well-made, and the figure was somewhat large and
broad-shouldered.</p>

<p>The Prophet’s dress was neat and plain as a
Quaker’s, of grey homespun, except the cravat and
waistcoat. His coat was of antique cut and, like
the pantaloons, baggy, and the buttons were black.
A necktie of dark silk, with a large bow, was passed
round a starchless collar. He wore a black satin
waistcoat, and plain gold chain. Altogether, the
Prophet’s appearance was that of a gentleman farmer
in New England.</p>

<p>His manner was affable and impressive, and
distinctly unpretentious. He showed no signs of
dogmatism or bigotry, and never once entered,
with me at least, on the subject of religion. He
impressed me with a certain sense of power.
It was commonly said there was only one chief in
Great Salt Lake City, and that was “Brigham.”
His temper was even, and his manner cold; in fact,
like his face, somewhat bloodless. He had great
powers of observation and judgment of character;
if he disliked a stranger at the first interview, he
never saw him again. He lived a most temperate
and sober life, his favourite food being baked potatoes,
with a little buttermilk, and his drink water; he
disapproved, like all strict Mormons, of spirituous
<!--Page 202-->
liquors, and never touched anything stronger than
a glass of lager beer, and never smoked tobacco.
His followers deemed him an angel of light, his
foes a fiend damned; he was, I presume, neither
one nor the other. He has been called a hypocrite,
swindler, forger, and murderer; no one looked it
less. In fact, he was the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul of the New
Dispensation; he gave point, energy, and consistency
to the disjointed and turbulent fanaticism of Mr.
Joseph Smith; and if he was not able to create, he
was at least able to control circumstances.</p>

<p>Such was His Excellency, President Brigham Young,
“painter and glazier”&mdash;&#8203;his earliest craft&mdash;&#8203;prophet,
revelator, translator, and seer; the man who was
revered as no king or kaiser, pope or pontiff, ever
was; who, like the Old Man of the Mountain, by
holding up his hand could cause the death of any
one within his reach; who, governing as well as
reigning, long stood up to fight with the sword of
the Lord, and with his few hundred guerillas, against
the mighty power of the United States; who outwitted
all diplomacy opposed to him; and, finally,
made a treaty of peace with the President of the
great Republic as though he had wielded the combined
power of France, Russia, and England.</p>

<p>The Prophet’s private office, where he was in the
habit of transacting the greater part of his business,
correcting his sermons, and conducting his correspondence,
was a plain, neat room, with a large
writing-table and money-safe. I remarked a pistol
<!--Page 203-->
and rifle hung within easy reach on the right-hand
wall. There was a look of order which suited the
character of the man, and his style of doing business
was to issue distinct directions to his employés, after
which he disliked referring to the subject. He had
the reputation of being a wealthy man, though he
began life as a poor one; and, so far as I could see,
he had made his money, not by enriching himself
by the tithes and plunder of his followers, but in
business and by hard work.</p>

<p>After the first few words of greeting, I interpreted
the Prophet’s look to mean that he would like to
know my object in coming to the City of the Saints.
I told him that, having read and heard much about
Utah as it was said to be, I was anxious to see Utah
as it was. He then touched upon agricultural and
other subjects; but we carefully avoided anything to
do with religion or his domestic peculiarities, on
which, I was warned, he disliked to be questioned.
After talking for about half an hour, the conversation
began to flag, so we rose up, shook hands all
round, as was the custom there, and took our leave.</p>

<p>The first impression left upon my mind, and subsequently
confirmed, was that the Prophet was no
common man, and that he had none of the weakness
and vanity which characterise the common uncommon
man. I also remarked the veneration shown to him
by his followers, whose affection for him was equalled
only by the confidence with which they entrusted
to him their dearest interests in this world and in
<!--Page 204-->
the next. After my visit many congratulated me,
as would the followers of Tien Wong, or Heavenly
King, upon having at last seen the most remarkable
man in the world.</p>

<p>The Prophet’s block was surrounded by a high wall
and strengthened with semi-circular buttresses; it
consisted of many houses. The Lion House was
occupied by Mrs. Young and her family in the eastern
part of the square. On the west of it lay the private
office, in which we were received, and further west
again was the public office, where the church and other
business was transacted. Beyond this was the Bee
House, so named from the sculptured bee-hive in front
of it. The Bee House was a large building with long
walls facing east and west. It was tenanted by the
Prophet’s “plurality wives” and their families, who
each had a bedroom, sitting-room, and closet, simply
and similarly furnished. There was a Moslem air of
retirement about the Bee House; the face of woman
was rarely seen at the window, and her voice was never
heard without. Anti-Mormons declared the Bee House
to be like the State prison of Auburn, a self-supporting
establishment, for not even the wives of the Prophet
were allowed to live in idleness.</p>

<p>As I have said before, I was unwilling to add to
those who had annoyed the Prophet by domestic
allusions, and have, therefore, no direct knowledge of
the extent to which he carried his polygamy; some
Gentiles allowed him seventeen, others thirty-six, wives
out of a household of seventy members, others an
<!--Page 205-->
indefinite number of wives scattered through the
different settlements. Of these, doubtless, many were
but wives by name&mdash;&#8203;such, for instance, as the wives of
the late Prophet; and others were married more for the
purpose of building up for themselves spiritual kingdoms
than for the normal purpose of matrimony. I
judged the Prophet’s progeny to be numerous from
the following circumstance. On one occasion, when
standing with him on the belvedere, my eye fell
upon a new erection; it could be compared externally
to nothing but an English gentleman’s hunting-stables,
and I asked him what it was intended for. “A
private school for my children,” he replied, “directed
by Brother Kelsey.”</p>

<p>The following Sunday I attended a Mormon service.
I passed the morning in the painful but appropriate
exercise of reading the books of Mormon and of
Moroni the prophet. Some people had told me that
it was the best imitation of the Old Testament existing;
to me it seemed to emulate the sprightliness of
Leviticus. Surely there never was a book so dull and
heavy; it was as monotonous as a sage prairie. In
Mormonism it holds the same place as the Bible in
the more ignorant Roman Catholic countries, where
religious reading is chiefly restricted to the Breviary,
tales of miracles, of saints, and so forth. It was
strictly proper, and did not contain a word about
materialism and polygamy.</p>

<p>The early part of the morning passed. At
9.45 a.m. we entered “the Bowery”; it was
<!--Page 206-->
advisable to go early to get seats within hearing.
This place was a kind of “hangar,” about one
hundred feet long by the same breadth, with a
roofing of bushes and boughs supported by rough
posts, and open for ventilation on the sides; it
contained about three thousand souls. The congregation
was accommodated upon long rows of benches,
opposite the dais, or tribune, which looked like a
long lane of boarding open to the north, where it
faced the audience, and entered by steps from the
east. Between the people and the platform was the
orchestra&mdash;&#8203;a violin, a bass, two women, and four
men performers&mdash;&#8203;who sang the sweet songs of Zion
tolerably well.</p>

<p>We took our seats on the benches, where we could
see the congregation flocking in, a proceeding which
was not over for half an hour. The people were all
in their Sunday best, and many a pretty face peeped
out from the sun-bonnet, though the “mushroom” and
the “pork-pie” had found their way over the plains,
and trim figures were clad in neat dresses, sometimes
with a little faded finery. The men were decently
attired; but the weather being hot, many of them had
left their coats at home, and had come in their shirt
sleeves. The custom, however, looked natural, and
there was no want of cleanliness, such as sometimes
lurks behind the bulwark of buttons. The elders
and dignitaries on the platform affected coats of black
broadcloth. All wore their hats till the address began,
then all uncovered. The number of old people
<!--Page 207-->
astonished me; half a dozen were sitting on the same
bench: these broken-down men and decrepit crones
had come to lay their bones in the Holy City.</p>

<p>At 10 a.m. the meeting opened with a spiritual
song, and then a civilised-looking man, being called
upon by the presiding Elder for the day, offered up
prayer. The matter was good, but somewhat commonplace.
The conclusion was an “Amen,” in which
all hands joined. It reminded me of the historical
practice of “humming” in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Next arose Bishop Abraham O. Smoot, second
Mayor of Zion, who began with “Brethring,” and
proceeded in a Methody tone of voice to praise the
saints and pitch into the apostates. He made an
undue use of the regular Wesleyan organ&mdash;&#8203;the nose;
but he appeared to speak excellent sense in execrable
English. As he was in the midst of an allusion to
the President, Brigham Young entered, and all turned
their faces, even the old lady who was sleeping
through the discourse.</p>

<p>The Prophet was dressed as usual in grey homespun
and home-woven; he wore, like most of the elders,
a tall, steeple-crowned straw hat, with a broad black
ribbon, and he had the gentility of black kid gloves.
He entered the tribune covered, and sat down. A
man in a fit was carried out pumpwards. Bishop
Smoot concluded with informing us that we should
live for God. Another hymn was sung. Then a
great silence, which told us that something was about
to happen: <em>that</em> old man held his cough; <em>that</em> old
<!--Page 208-->
lady awoke with a start; <em>that</em> child ceased to squall.
President Brigham Young removed his hat, advanced
to the end of the tribune, expectorated into the
spittoon, restored the balance of fluid by a glass of
water from a decanter on a stand, and, leaning slightly
forwards with both hands propped on the green baize
of the tribune, addressed his followers.</p>

<p>The discourse began slowly, word crept titubantly
after word, and the opening phrases were scarcely
audible; but as the orator warmed, his voice rose
high and sonorous, and a fluency so remarkable
succeeded hesitation that the latter seemed to have
been a work of art. The gestures were easy and
rounded, except one of raising and shaking the forefinger,
which struck me as threatening and bullying.
The address was long. Mormonism was a great
fact. Religion had made him, Brigham Young, the
happiest of men. He was ready to dance like a
Shaker. At this the Prophet, who was a good mimic
and had much of humour, raised his right arm, and
gave, to the amusement of the congregation, a droll
imitation of the Shakers. A great deal of what
followed contained topical allusions. The Saints had
a glorious destiny before them, and their morality
was remarkable as the beauty of the Promised Land.
The soft breeze blowing over the Bowery, and the
glorious sunshine outside, made the allusion highly
appropriate. After a somewhat lengthy string of
sentences concerning the great tribulation coming on
earth&mdash;&#8203;it had been coming for the last eighteen
<!--Page 209-->
hundred years&mdash;&#8203;he concluded with good wishes to
visitors and Gentiles generally, with a solemn blessing
upon the President of the United States, the
territorial Governor, and all that be in authority over
us, and with an “Amen” which was loudly re-echoed
by all around, he restored his hat and resumed
his seat.</p>

<p>Then arose Mr. Heber C. Kimball, the second
President. He was the model of a Methodist, a tall,
powerful man, with dark, piercing eyes and clean-shaven,
blue face. He affected the Boanerges style,
from a certain dislike to the Nonconformist rant and
whine, and his manner of speech savoured rather of
familiarity than of reverence. Several of his remarks
were loudly laughed at by the congregation. His
style of oratory was certainly startling; he reminded
me of Luther’s description of Tetzel’s sermon, in
which he used to shout the words “Bring! bring!
bring!” with such a horrible bellowing that one
would have said it was a mad bull rushing on the
people and goring them with its horns.</p>

<p>After this worthy’s address, a list of names for
whom letters were lying unclaimed was called from
the platform. A missionary adjourned the meeting
till two o’clock, delivered the prayer of dismissal,
during which all stood up, and ended with the
Benediction and “Amen.” The Sacrament was not
administered on this occasion. It was often given,
and reduced to the very elements of a ceremony; even
water was used instead of wine, because the latter is of
<!--Page 210-->
Gentile manufacture. Two elders walked up and down
the rows, one carrying a pitcher, the other a plate of
broken bread, and each Saint partook of both.</p>

<p>That same evening when dining out, I had a
lesson in Mormon modesty. The mistress of the
house, a Gentile but not an anti-Mormon, was
requested by a saintly visitor, who was also a widow,
to instruct me that on no account I must propose
to see her home. “Mormon ladies,” said my kind informant,
“are very strict”; “Unnecessarily so on this
occasion,” I could not help adding. Something similar
occurred on another occasion: a very old lady, wishing
to return home, surreptitiously left the room and
sidled out of the garden gate, and my companion,
an officer from Camp Floyd, at once recognised the
object of the retreat&mdash;&#8203;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr></i> to avoid our possible escort.
I afterwards learned at dinner and elsewhere amongst
the Mormons to abjure the Gentile practice of giving
precedence to the fair sex. The lesson, however, was
not new; I had been taught the same, in times past,
amongst certain German missionaries, who assumed
precedence over their wives upon a principle borrowed
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul.</p>

<p>There was a certain monotony of life in Great Salt
Lake City, a sameness from day to day, which does
not render the subject favourable for a lively description;
moreover, the Moslem gloom, the result of
austere morals and manner, of the semi-seclusion of
the sexes, and, in my case, the reserve arising towards
a stranger who appeared in the train of Federal
<!--Page 211-->
officials, hung over society. We rose early, and
breakfasted at any hour between 6 and 9 a.m. Then
ensued “business,” which seemed to consist principally
of correcting one’s teeth and a walk about the
town, with an occasional liquor up. Dinner was at
1 p.m., announced not by the normal gong of Eastern
States, but by a most discordant hand-bell. Jostling
into the long room of the ordinary, we took our
seats, and, seizing our forks, proceeded at once to
action. Nothing but water was drunk at dinner,
except when a gentleman preferred to wash down
roast pork with a tumbler of milk. Wine in this
part of the world was dear and bad, and even if the
Saints made their own, it could scarcely be cheap, on
account of the price of labour. The feeding ended
with a glass of liquor, not at the bar, because there
was none, but in the privacy of one’s own chamber,
which takes from drinking half its charms. Most
of the well-to-do men found time for a siesta in the
afternoon. There was supper at 6 p.m., and the
evening was quietly spent with a friend.</p>

<p>To describe Great Salt Lake City in those days
without some account of polygamy would be like
seeing <cite>Hamlet</cite> with the part of the Prince of
Denmark omitted. It is, I suppose, therefore necessary
to supply a popular view of the peculiar institution
which at once was the bane and the blessing of
Mormonism&mdash;&#8203;plurality. I approach the subject with
a feeling of despair, so conflicting are opinions concerning
it, and so difficult is it to naturalise in Europe
<!--Page 212-->
the customs of Asia, Africa, and America, and
reconcile the habits of the nineteenth century <span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span>
with those of 1900 <span class="sc lowercase">B.C.</span> A return to the patriarchal
ages must necessarily have its disadvantages.</p>

<p>I found that the marriage ceremony was performed
in the Temple, or, if that was impossible, in Mr.
Brigham Young’s office, properly speaking, by the
Prophet, who, however, could depute any follower
to act for him. When mutual consent was given,
the parties were pronounced man and wife in the name
of Jesus Christ; prayers followed, and there was a
patriarchal feast of joy in the evening.</p>

<p>The first wife, as amongst polygamists generally,
was <em>the</em> wife, and assumed the husband’s name and
title. Her plurality partners were called sisters, such
as Sister Anne, or Sister Maria, and were the “aunts”
of her children. The first wife was married for
time, the others were sealed for eternity. Girls rarely
remained single past sixteen (in England the average
marrying age is thirty), and they would have been
the pity of the community if they had been doomed
to a waste of youth so unnatural.</p>

<p>Divorce was rarely obtained by the man, who was
ashamed to own that he could not keep his house
in order. Some, such as the President, would grant
it only in the case of adultery; and here I may say
the two mortal sins in Mormonism are (1) adultery,
and (2) shedding innocent blood. Wives, however,
were allowed to claim it for cruelty, desertion, or neglect.
Mormon women married to Gentiles were cut off from
<!--Page 213-->
the society of the Saints, and without uncharitableness
men suspected a sound previous reason. The widows
of the Prophet were married to his successor, as
David took unto himself the wives of Saul; being
generally aged, they occupied the position of matron
rather than wife, and the same was the case where
a man espoused a mother and her daughter.</p>

<p>There were rules and regulations of Mormonism.
All sensuality in the married state was strictly
forbidden beyond that necessary to procure progeny&mdash;&#8203;the
practice, in fact, of Adam and Abraham.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go into the arguments
which are adduced by the Mormons in favour of
polygamy, nor to recount the arguments on the
other side. I content myself here with stating facts
as I saw them. It will be asked, What view did the
softer sex take of this state of affairs? A few, mostly
from the Old Country, lamented that Mr. Joseph
Smith ever asked of the Creator that question which
was answered in the affirmative. A very few, like
the Curia Electa, Emma, the first wife of Mr. Joseph
Smith&mdash;&#8203;who said of her, by-the-bye, that she could
not be contented in Heaven without rule&mdash;&#8203;apostatised,
and became Mrs. Brideman. But most of the women
were even more in favour of polygamy than the men.
For this attachment of the women of the Saints
to the doctrine of plurality I found two reasons.
The Mormon prophets expended all their arts upon
this end, well knowing that without the hearty
co-operation of mothers and wives, sisters and
<!--Page 214-->
daughters, their institution could not exist long.
They bribed them with promises of Paradise, they
subjugated them with threats of annihilation. With
them, once a Mormon always a Mormon. The
apostate Mormon was looked upon by other people
as a scamp and a knave, and as regards a woman,
she was looked upon as worse than a prostitute.
The Mormon household has been described by its
enemies as a hell of hatred, envy, and malice; the
same has been said of the Moslem harem; both, I
believe, suffer from the assertions of prejudice or
ignorance.</p>

<p>Another curious effect may be noticed. When a
man had four or five wives, with reasonable families
by each, he was fixed for life; his interests, if not
his affections, bound him irrevocably to his New
Faith. But the bachelor, as well as the monogamic
youth, was prone to backsliding and apostacy. This,
when I was at Great Salt Lake City, was apparently
so common that many of the new Saints formed a
mere floating population. But without expressing
any further opinions (those I have given so far are
merely the opinions of others), I may say that the
result of my investigations was to prove that Great
Salt Lake City had been wonderfully successful in
its colonisation. Physically speaking, there was no
comparison between the Saints and the class from
which they were mostly taken, and, in point of view
of mere morality, the Mormon community was perhaps
purer than any other of equal numbers.</p>

<p><!--Page 215-->
About the middle of September the time for my
departure drew nigh. I prepared for difficulties by
having my hair “shingled off,” till my head somewhat
resembled a pointer’s dorsum, and deeply regretted
having left all my wigs behind me. We laid in a
good store of provisions, not forgetting an allowance
of whiskey and schnapps.</p>

<p>My last evening was spent in the genial company
of a few friends. I thanked Governor Cumming for
his generous hospitality, and made my acknowledgments
to the courtesy of his amiable wife. My
adieux were on an extensive scale, and the next day,
September 19th, in the morning, I left Great Salt
Lake City, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for the South.</p>

<p>The day was fine and wondrous clear, affording a
splendid back view of the Happy Valley before it
was finally shut out from sight, and the Utah Lake
looked a very gem of beauty, a diamond in its setting
of steelly blue mountains. It was with a feeling of
real regret that I bade adieu to the City of the Saints.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent dropcap">IT is a long stride from Salt Lake City to
Dahomé, from the Mormons to the Amazons,
but I take my visit to the King of Dahomé as
next in date. Before, however, beginning my
journey to Dahomé let me touch briefly on that
much-vexed and little-understood subject&mdash;&#8203;the
negro.</p>

<p>Central Intertropical Africa, lying between north
latitude 10° and south latitude 20°, at that time
contained eight considerable negro circles, which may
be called kingdoms. Of these there were three on
the west coast north of the Equator, namely:</p>

<p>1st. Ashanti, the land which exports the “Minas”
negroes. This despotism has been well known to
us since the beginning of the present century. The
capital is Kumasi, nearly 133 direct miles from the
coast. This empire may be said to rest on two pillars,
blood and gold. Human sacrifice was excessive,
and the “customs” mean the slaughter of fellow-creatures.</p>

<p><abbr title="second">2nd.</abbr> Benin, a kingdom well known to old travellers,
and the place where Belzoni of the Pyramids died.
<!--Page 220-->
I visited it in August, 1862, and my reception was
the crucifixion of a negro. On the night after my
arrival a second slave was slain and placed before
my doorway. My lodgings commanded a view of
the principal square, which was strewn with human
bones, <em>green</em> and <em>white</em>.</p>

<p><abbr title="third">3rd.</abbr> Dahomé. From the plain and unvarnished
account of this tyranny, which I am about to relate,
may be estimated the amount of hopeless misery which
awaited the African in Africa. And as it is unsatisfactory
to point out a disease without suggesting a
remedy, I will propose my panacea at the end of
this essay.</p>

<p>We now cross the Equator and find ourselves
among the great South African family. Their
common origin is proved by their speech. Briefly
to characterise their language, the place of our genders
are taken by personal and impersonal forms, and all
changes of words are made at the beginning, not, as
with us, at the end. The Kaffir (Caffre race in South-east
Africa) is evidently a mixed breed, and it has
nearly annihilated the Bushmen and the Hottentots&mdash;&#8203;the
original lords of the land. There is a curious
resemblance between the Coptic, or Old Egyptian, and
the Hottentot tongues, which suggests that in the
prehistoric ages one language extended from the
Nile Valley to the Cape of Good Hope. The true
negroes, distinguished by their long, ape-like head and
projecting jaws, bowed shins and elongated heels and
forearms, are all the tribes of Intertropical Africa
<!--Page 221-->
whose blood is unmixed. This is my definition; but
of this point opinions differ.</p>

<p>And here we may stand to view the gleam of light
which the future casts across the Dark Continent.
Slowly but surely the wave of Moslem conquest rolls
down towards the line. Every Moslem is a propagandist,
and their traders, unlike ours, carry conversion
with them. This fact European missionaries deny,
because they do not like it: they would rather preach
to heathens than to Moslems, whom Locke describes
as unorthodox Christians. They even deny the
superiority of El Islam, which forbids the pagan
abominations of child-murder, human sacrifice, witch-burning,
ordeal-poisons, and horrors innumerable.
But we, who look forward to the advent of a
higher law, of a nobler humanity, hail with infinite
pleasure every sign of progress.</p>

<p>Philanthropists, whose heads are sometimes softer
than their hearts, have summed up their opinion
of slavery as the “sum of all villainies.” I look upon
it as an evil, to the slaveholder even more than to
the slave, but a necessary evil, or, rather, a condition
of things essentially connected, like polygamy, with
the progress of human society, especially in the tropics.
The savage hunting tribes slave for themselves;
they are at the bottom of the ladder. Advancing to
agricultural and settled life, man must have assistants,
hands, slaves. As population increases, commerce
develops itself and free labour fills the markets; the
slave and the serf are emancipated: they have done
<!--Page 222-->
their task; they disappear from the community, never
more to return. Hence every nation, Hindu and
Hebrew, English and French, have had slaves; all
rose to their present state of civilisation by the “sum
of all villainies.” And here, when owning slavery to
be an evil, I must guard against being misunderstood.
It is an evil to the white man: it is often an incalculable
boon to the black. In the case of the
negro it is life, it is comfort, it is civilisation; in
the case of the white it has done evil by retarding
progress, by demoralising society, and by giving
rise to a mixed race.</p>

<p>And there is yet another point to be settled when
speaking of the negro. In the United States every
black man is a negro, or, to speak politely, a “cullard
pussun.” Thus the noble races of Northern Africa
and the half-Arab Moors, the Nubians and Abyssinians,
and the fine Kaffir (Caffre) type of South-eastern Africa
are confounded with the anthropoid of Sierra Leone,
of the Guinea and of the Congo regions. The
families first mentioned differ more from the true
negro than they do from the white man.</p>

<p>My first visit to Gelele, then King of Dahomé,
was in May and June, 1863. Already in 1861 I had
proposed to restore those amicable relations which
we had with his father Gezo; but my application
was not accepted by the Government. On my return
to the West African coast after a six weeks’ visit
to England, the journey was made on my own
responsibility, and it was not pleasant. I was alone&mdash;&#8203;in
<!--Page 223-->
such matters negroes do not count as men&mdash;&#8203;and
four mortal days upon the Slave Coast lagoons, salt,
miry rivers, rich only in mud, miasma, and mosquitoes,
with drenching rains and burning suns playing upon
a cramping canoe without awning, are unsatisfactory
even to remember. Having reached Whydah, the
seaport and slave-market of Dahomé, I procured
a hammock, and in three days I arrived at Kana, a
summer residency for the Court, distant 7,500 miles
from Agbomé, the capital.</p>

<p>The human sacrifices called the “nago customs”
had lately ended. Twelve men had lost their lives,
and, dressed in various attire like reapers, dancers,
and musicians, had been exposed on tall scaffolds
of strong scantling. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est se moquer de l’humanité</i>,”
remarked to me the Principal of the French Mission
at Whydah. But the corpses had been removed, and
during my flying visit of five days nothing offensive
was witnessed.</p>

<p>At Kana I met M. Jules Gerard, first “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le chasseur</i>,”
then “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le tueur des lions</i>”: we had sailed together
from Europe to Madeira, and he had been sea-sick
during the whole voyage. Men who have spent
their youth in the excitement of dangerous sport
often lose their nerve in middle age. This was the
case with the unfortunate lion-hunter; the sight of the
“customs” threw him into a fever. Disappointment
also weighed upon his spirits. He came to West
Africa in the hope that his fame as a killer of lions
had preceded him; but the only lion that can exist
<!--Page 224-->
in that mouldy climate is the British lion, and even
he is not a terrible beast to bring amongst the ladies.
He expected to find Dahomé a kind of Algiers, and
he exchanged a good for a very bad country. He
had set his mind upon crossing the northern frontier;
but the king at once put an end to that plan, and
afterwards played me the same trick. He had also
based his hopes upon his good shooting and upon
an explosive bullet calculated to do great execution;
but many of the king’s women guards could use
their guns better than he did, and when the said shell
was produced, Gelele sent to his stores and brought
out a box-full.</p>

<p>M. Gerard proposed to himself a journey which
would have severely tried the health of the strongest
man in Europe. He resolved to make his way from
the Gulf of Guinea through dangerous Timbuktu
(Timbuctos) and the terrible Sahara to Algiers. I
advised him to retire to Teneriffe or Madeira and
recruit his energies. But he was game to the last.
He made another departure through the malarious
Sherbro country, south of pestilential Sierra Leone.
The next thing we heard of him was when crossing
the Jong River he had been drowned by the upsetting
of a canoe. Somewhat later came the report that
he had been foully murdered. I was rejoiced to hear
that a subscription had been raised for his aged and
bereaved mother.</p>

<p>Having reported that Dahomé was, under normal
circumstances, as safe as most parts of Africa, I received
<!--Page 225-->
in August, 1863, orders to visit it as Commissioner.
My “mission” was to make certain presents to the
king, and to preach up cotton and palm oil versus
war and human sacrifices. I may begin by saying I
lectured hard and talked to the wind.</p>

<p><abbr title="Her Majesty's">H.M.’s</abbr> cruiser <span class="title">Antelope</span> landed me at Whydah
in December, the dry season, and the surf was not
particularly dangerous. The beach is open; between
it and Brazil rolls the broad Atlantic; and near the
shore are an outer and inner sandbar with an interval
forming a fine breeding-ground for sharks. A girl
is occasionally thrown in as an offering to “Hu,” the
sea-dog, and this does not diminish the evil.</p>

<p>We entered Whydah in state, paraded and surrounded
by chiefs and soldiery in war dress, kilts
and silver horns like the giraffe’s: their arms were
long guns and short swords for decapitating the
wounded. Each troop had its flag, its umbrella,
its band of drums and tom-toms, its horns and
cymbals. I especially remarked a gourd bottle full
of, and covered with, cowries, or pebbles&mdash;&#8203;in fact the
celebrated “maraca” of Brazil, which, it has been
conjectured, contributed towards the formation of
the word America. Every five minutes the warriors
halted to drink and dance. The drink is easily
described&mdash;&#8203;tafia or bad caxaca. But the dance! I
defy mortal man to paint it in words. Let me briefly
say that the arms are held up as though the owner
were running, the elbows being jerked so as nearly
to meet behind the back; the hands paddle like the
<!--Page 226-->
paws of a swimming dog; the feet shuffle and stamp
as though treading water; the body-trunk joins in
the play, and the hips move backwards and forwards
to the beating time. The jig and the hornpipe are
repose compared with this performance. There is
also a decapitation dance over an ideal dead enemy,
whose head is duly sawn off with the edge of the hand.</p>

<p>At Whydah I lodged at the English fort, a
large double-storied building of “taipa,” tenanted by
Wesleyan missionaries. It was once a strong place,
as the ruined towers and burst guns show.</p>

<p>There were three other forts in the town. The
Brazilian, which was nearest the sea, was held by
Chico de Souza, the son of the late Francisco Fellis de
Souza. This was a remarkable man. Born at Cachoeira,
near Bahia, he emigrated to Africa, where by courage
and conduct he became the Chacha, or Governor, of
the Guild of Merchants, a kind of Board of Trade.
He made an enormous fortune, and by his many
wives he left about a hundred olive branches.
Though a slave-dealer, he was a man of honour
and honesty. The English had done him many an
injury, yet he was invariably courteous and hospitable
to every English traveller. He strongly opposed
human sacrifice, and he saved many lives by curious
contrivances. Of the same stamp was M. Domingos
Martins of Bahia, once celebrated for enormous
wealth. He died in the interval between my first
and second visits. I regretted his death, for he
had been most kind and attentive to me.</p>

<p><!--Page 227-->
The Portuguese fort had also been repaired, and
was inhabited by six members of the Lyons Mission,
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Vicariate Apostolique de Dahomé</i>.” They kept a
school, and they were apparently convinced that it
was hopeless to attempt the conversion of adults.
The superior, Father François Borghero, had several
times been ill-treated by the barbarians, and his hatred
of idolatry had exposed him to not a little danger. It
is rare in those lands to find a highly educated and
thoroughly gentlemanly man; and, looking back, I am
not surprised that all my time not occupied by study
or observation was spent in the Portuguese fort.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was the French fort, in far better condition
than the others. It was held in my time by M.
Marius Daumas, agent to M. Regis (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aîné</i>) of Marseilles,
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faute de mieux</i> he was buying and shipping palm
oil.</p>

<p>Whydah was easily seen. The houses were red
“taipa” with thick thatch, and each had its large and
slovenly courtyard. The market-place was a long
street of small booths open to the front, where
everything from a needle to a moleque (small slave-boy)
could be bought. The thoroughfares were
studded with small round roofs of grass, which
sheltered a hideous deity called Legba. He was made
of muddy clay, with holes for eyes and cowries for
teeth, and he squatted before a pot in which the
faithful placed provisions, which were devoured by the
urubu (vulture). The chief temple was dedicated to
the danh, or snake, which here was the principal
<!--Page 228-->
“fetish.” It was a circular hut with two doorless
entrances, and the venerated boas curled themselves
comfortably on the thickness of the walls. The
largest was about six feet long, and it was dangerous
only to rats, of which it was very fond. Several
foreigners had been killed for injuring these reptiles,
and Whydah, once an independent kingdom, lost
her liberty through the snakes. When attacked by
Dahomé in 1729, her chief defence was to place a
serpent on the invaders’ path. The Dahomans
killed the guardian genius and slaughtered the
Whydahs till the streets ran blood. But, when
the conquerors had reduced their neighbour, they
gave her leave to adore the snake, and Whydah felt
consoled, even happy. It sounds like a traveller’s
tale. I am writing history.</p>

<p>At Whydah we complied with the custom of
sending up a messenger to report our arrival. After
three days came three officials from the palace, who
presented their sticks and delivered to me a verbal
invitation from their master. The sticks were white
sticks, two feet long, adorned with plates of silver,
cut into the shapes of lions, sharks, crocodiles, and
other savage beasts. These batons served as visiting
cards, and were signs of dignity. When the king
made me honorary commandant of a corps of life-guardswomen,
he sent me two sticks by way of
commission or diploma.</p>

<p>We set out <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for the capital on December
13th, 1863. My little party consisted of Mr. George
<!--Page 229-->
Cruikshank, a naval assistant-surgeon detached to
accompany me; the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Bernasco, Wesleyan
missionary and private friend of the king; two negro
interpreters, thirty hammock men, and a troop of
baggage porters. This made up a total of ninety-nine
mouths, which were never idle except when asleep.</p>

<p>Between the seaboard and Kana, the “villegiatura,”
or country capital, of the king, there were fifty-two
to fifty-three direct miles. The country was here a
campo, or rolling grassy prairie: there was a dense
and magnificent forest. At every few miles there
were settlements, now villages, once capitals which
felt the weight of the Dahomé arm. The first was
Savé, ancient metropolis of the Whydah kingdom,
when the present Whydah, which was properly Gle-hwe,
or the Garden House, was only a squalid port. The
territory was only thirty miles by seven, but it mustered
200,000 fighting men. This, however, was easily
explained. In Africa every male between the ages
of seventeen and fifty carried arms: this would be
about one-fifth of the population; consequently there
was one million inhabitants in an area of two
hundred square miles (4,762 souls to each mile).</p>

<p>After Savé came Tevé, also an ex-capital. It was
a pretty little village commanded by a Dahoman
“caboceer.” This frequently used word is a corruption
of a Portuguese corruption, “caboceer,” or, rather,
“caboceira,” and means a pillow, a headman, or
a chief officer. The etiquette on arriving at such
places is as follows. You alight from your hammock
<!--Page 230-->
before the tree under which the grandee and his
party are drawn up to receive you with vociferous
shouts, with singing, drumming, and dancing. After
the first greetings you pledge him in fresh water,
which he has tasted before you. Then you drink
spirits and receive an offering of provisions. You
make a return of rum and gin, the people drum,
dance, sing, and shout their thanks, and you are
at liberty to proceed.</p>

<p>On the fourth day we crossed the “Agrime Swamp,”
which is hardly practicable in the wet season. The
road then entered upon a true continent: we emerged
from the false coast, which at one time was under
water, and which is raised by secular upheaval. At
the little town of Agrime we were delayed till the
king, who was in his country capital, sent an escort
and permission to advance.</p>

<p>On Friday, December 18th, we entered Kana, a
large and scattered town, shaded by magnificent trees.
It is about two hundred and seventy feet above sea-level,
and the climate is a relief after Whydah. The
morrow was fixed for our reception. It was Ember
Day, and the date could hardly have been better
chosen.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to form an idea of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peine
forte et dure</i> attending the presentation in Africa.
It is every negro’s object to keep the white man
waiting as long as possible, and the visitor must
be very firm and angry if he would not lose all his
time.</p>

<p><!--Page 231-->
We were duly warned to be ready at 10 a.m.;
but local knowledge kept me in the house till
1 p.m. Then we sat under a tree upon the
chairs which we had brought from Whydah, to
witness the procession of “caboceers.” Each grandee,
preceded by his flag or flags, his band of drums
and rattles, and his armed retainers dancing and
singing, passed before us, shaded by an enormous
umbrella of many colours. Having marched round,
he came up to us and snapped fingers (the local
style of shaking hands); then he drank with us three
toasts, beginning with his master’s health. After the
“caboceers” trooped various companies&mdash;&#8203;musicians,
eunuchs, and jesters. The last are buffoons, reminding
one of our feudal days. Their entertainment
consists in “making faces” (<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">cara feia</i>), as children
say&mdash;&#8203;wrinkling the forehead, protruding the tongue,
and clapping the jaws as apes do. They can tumble
a little and “throw the cart wheel” neatly; they
dance in a caricatured style, draw in the stomach
to show that they are hungry, pretend to be deaf
and dumb, smoke a bone by way of a pipe, and
imitate my writing by scratching a sweet potato with
a stick.</p>

<p>The review over, we made for the palace in a
long procession; my men, wearing bright red caps
and waist-cloths, carried the flag of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George. The
royal abodes are all on the same pattern: enclosures
of “taipa” wall, four courses high, and pierced with
eight or ten gates. The irregular square or oblong
<!--Page 232-->
may be half a mile in circumference. At the principal
entrances are thatched sheds like verandahs, one
hundred feet long by fourteen to fifteen feet deep.
The roof ledge rises sixty to seventy feet high,
enough for two stories, whilst the eaves of thick and
solidly packed straw rested upon posts barely four
feet tall. The inner buildings, as far as they could
be seen, corresponded with the external, and the king
held his levées in one of these barn-like sheds. The
royal sleeping-places, which were often changed, were
described to me as neat rooms, divided from the courtyard
by a wall with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i> of human
jawbones. The floors were paved with the skulls
of conquered chiefs, forming a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">descente de lit</i> upon
which Gelele had the daily pleasure of trampling.</p>

<p>The complicated reception was typical of the
Dahoman military empire. We found, ranged in
a line outside the gate, twenty-four umbrellas or
brigades belonging to the highest male dignitaries.
The army, or, what was here synonymous, the
Court, was divided into two portions, male and
female, or, rather, female and male, as the women
troops took precedence. They occupied the inside
of the palace, and they were the king’s bodyguard
in peace or war. Each line had a right and
a left wing, so called from their position relative
to the throne. The former, which is the senior, was
commanded by the “min-gau” who cumulated
the offices of premier and head executioner. His
lieutenant was the adanejan. Dahoman officials, for
<!--Page 235-->
better espionage, were always in pairs. The general
of the left wing was the “meu,” who collected revenue
and tribute, declared war, and had charge of all
strangers. His <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alter ego</i> was styled the ben-wan-ton.
Under these great men were smaller great men, and
all were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i> as well as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</i> slaves to the
king.</p>

<!--Page 234--><!--Blank Page-->

<p>Presently we were summoned to enter the palace.
We closed our umbrellas by order, walked hurriedly
across a large yard, and halted at a circle of white
sand spread upon the clayey ground. Here we
bowed to a figure sitting under the shady thatch;
and he returned, we were told, the compliment.
The chief ministers who accompanied us fell flat
upon the sand, kissed it, rolled in it, and threw it
by handfuls over their heads and robes of satin
and velvet. The ceremony is repeated at every
possible opportunity; and when the king drinks, all
the subjects turn their backs upon him and shout.</p>

<p><a name="king" id="king"></a>Then we advanced to the clay bench upon which
King Gelele sat. After the usual quadruple bows
and hand-wavings, he stood up, tucked in his toga,
descended to the ground, and, aided by nimble feminine
fingers, donned his sandals. He then greeted me
with sundry vigorous wrings <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à la John Bull</i>, and
inquired after Queen Victoria, the Ministry, and
the people of England, which country is supposed
to be like Dahomé, but a little larger and richer.</p>

<p>Our chairs were then placed before the seat, to
which he returned, and we drank the normal three
<!--Page 236-->
toasts to his health. On these occasions it is not
necessary to empty the glass, which may be handed
to an attendant. Salutes having been fired, we
retired a hundred feet from the presence and sat
under giant umbrellas.</p>

<p>Gelele was then about forty-five years old, upwards
of six feet high, olive complexioned, athletic and
well made, with clear signs of African blood. His
dress was simple to excess: a loose shirt of plain
white stuff edged with green silk, a small smoking-cap,
a few iron rings on his arms, and a human tooth
strung round his neck. The only splendour was
in his gold and scarlet sandals, here distinctive of
royalty. They were studded with crosses, also royal
emblems. He called himself a Christian, and he was
a Moslem as well: like all barbarians, he would rather
believe too much than too little, and he would give
himself every chance in both worlds.</p>

<p>Under the thatch behind the king were his wives,
known by their handsome dresses, silver hair studs,
and the absence of weapons. They atoned for want
of beauty by excessive devotion to their lord, who
apparently did everything by proxy except smoke his
long-stemmed clay pipe.</p>

<p>The inner court of the palace reflected the outer,
and the women sat in the sun along the external wall
of the royal shed with their musket-barrels bristling
upwards. The right wing was commanded by a
“premieress,” who executed all women; the left
was also under the she “meu.” A semicircle of
<!--Page 237-->
bamboos lying on the ground separated the sexes at
levées. The instrument of communication was a
woman-messenger, who, walking up to the bamboos,
delivered her message on all fours to the “meu.”
The latter proclaimed it to the many.</p>

<p>I must here say a few words about the Amazons,
or fighting women. The corps was a favourite with
the late king, who thus checked the turbulence and
treachery of his male subjects. The number was
estimated at 10,000 to 12,000; I do not believe it
exceeded 2,500. They were divided into blunderbuss-women,
elephant-hunters, beheaders, who carry razors
four feet long, and the line armed with muskets and
short swords.</p>

<p>All the Amazons were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex-officio</i> royal wives, and the
first person who made the king a father was one of
his soldieresses. It was high treason to touch them
even accidentally; they lodged in the palace, and when
they went abroad all men, even strangers, had to clear
off the road. Gelele often made his visitors honorary
commandants of his guard of Amazons (I was made
one); but this did not entitle them to inspect
companies.</p>

<p>Such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> makes the Amazons, as might be
expected, intolerably fierce. Their sole object in life
is blood-spilling and head-snatching. They pride
themselves upon not being men, and with reason.
The soldiers blink and shrink when they fire their
guns; the soldieresses do not. The men run away;
the women fight to the bitter end. In the last
<!--Page 238-->
attack on the city of Abokuta (March 15th, 1864)
several of the Amazons of my own regiment scaled
the walls; their brethren-in-arms hardly attempted
the feat.</p>

<p>Dahomé thus presented the anomaly of an African
kingdom in which women took precedence of men.
Hence every employé of Government had to choose a
“mother”&mdash;&#8203;that is to say, some elderly Amazon officer
who would look after his interests at headquarters.
Often he had two, an “old mother,” dating from the
days of the late king, and a “young mother,” belonging
to the actual reign. He had to pay them well, or his
affairs were inevitably bad. Thus there was also a
Brazilian, an English, and a French “mother”; and
visitors of those nations were expected to propitiate
their fond and unpleasant parents with presents of
cloth, jewelry, perfumes, and so forth.</p>

<p>The levée ended with a kind of parade. A few
simple manœuvres and many furious decapitation
dances were performed by a select company of the
young Amazons. They were decently dressed in
long sleeveless waistcoats, petticoats of various coloured
cottons, secured at the waist by a sash and extending
to the ankles, whilst narrow fillets of ribbon secured
their hair and denoted their corps. Their arms were
muskets and short swords, and all had belts, bullet
bags, and cartridge boxes.</p>

<p>When the sun set a bottle of rum was sent to
us. At this hint we rose and prepared to retire.
Gelele again descended from his seat and accompanied
<!--Page 239-->
us to the gate, preceded by a buzzing swarm of
courtiers, who smoothed every inch of ground for
the royal foot. He finally shook hands with us,
and promised to meet us in a few days at Agbomé,
the capital.</p>

<p>We lost no time in setting out for Agbomé, and
were surprised to find an excellent carriage road, broad
and smooth, between the two cities. Agbomé had
no hotels, but we managed lodgings at the house of
the bukono, a high officer who was doctor and wizard
to the Court and curator of strangers, whom he fleeced
pitilessly.</p>

<p>I will now touch briefly on the ill-famed “customs”
of Dahomé. The word is taken from the Portuguese
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">costume</i>, and here means the royal sacrifices. Many
travellers have witnessed them, but no one has
attempted to inquire into their origin. I attribute
these murderous customs not to love of bloodshed,
but simply to filial piety.</p>

<p>The Dahoman, like the ancient Egyptian, holds
this world to be his temporary lodging. His own
home is Ku-to-men, or Deadman’s Land. It is not
a place of rewards and punishments, but a Hades
for ghosts, a region of shades, where the king will
rule for ever and where the slave will always serve.
The idea is ever present to the popular mind. When,
for instance, sunshine accompanies rain the Dahoman
says the spirits are marketing. In Brazil the fox is
marrying; in England the devil is beating his wife.</p>

<p>A deceased king cannot, therefore, be sent to Ku-to-men
<!--Page 240-->
as a common negro. At his interment a small
court must be slain&mdash;&#8203;leopard-wives (that is to say,
young and handsome wives), old wives, ministers,
friends, soldiers, musicians, men and women. These
are the grand customs, which may average one
thousand to two thousand deaths. The annual customs,
which we were now to witness, reinforce the ghostly
court, and number from eighty to one hundred head.</p>

<p>But destruction of life does not end here. All
novelties, such as the arrival of an officer in uniform,
must be reported to the dead by the living king. A
captive or a criminal is summoned, and the message
is given to him. He is made to swallow a bottle
of rum, whose object is to keep him in a good
humour, and his head is then and there struck off.
Only on one occasion did the patient object to the
journey, saying that he did not know the road to
Ku-to-men. “You shall soon find it out!” cried
the king, who at once decapitated the wretch without
rum. If any portion of the message be forgotten,
another victim must be despatched with it. A hard-hearted
traveller calls this the postscript.</p>

<p>A Dahoman king neglecting these funeral rites
would have been looked upon as the most impious
of men, and a powerful priesthood would soon have
sent him to Ku-to-men on his own account. It
may now be understood how hopeless was my mission.
It may be compared, without disrespect, to memorialising
the Vatican against masses for the dead. The king’s
sole and necessary answer was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non possumus</i>.</p>

<p><!--Page 241-->
The “customs” began on December 28th, 1863,
and ended on January 25th, 1864. They were of
two kinds. The first was performed by Gelele, king
of the city; the second are in the name of Addo-Kpon,
ruler of the “bush,” or country&mdash;&#8203;also Gelele. The
ruler of Dahomé was thus double, two persons in one,
and each had his separate palace and property, mothers
and ministers, Amazons, officers, and soldiers. I
have conjectured that the reason of this strange
organisation is that the “bush-king” may buy and
sell, which the “city-king” holds to be below his
dignity.</p>

<p>The description of a single “custom” will suffice.
About midday of December 28th, when summoned
to the palace, we passed through the market-place,
and we found the victim-shed finished and furnished.
This building was a long, wall-less barn one hundred
feet long, the roof was a thatch covered with a
striped cloth on a blood-red ground and supported
by tree trunks. On the west was a two-storied tower,
sixty feet high, with four posts in front of each
floor. There were on this occasion twenty victims
sitting on stools, each before his post, with his arms
around it and his wrists lashed together outside it.
The confinement was not cruel; each had a slave
to flap away the flies, all were fed four times a day,
and they were released at night. The dress was a
long white nightcap and a calico shirt with blue and
crimson patches and bindings. A white man would
have tried to escape; these negroes are led like
<!--Page 242-->
black sheep to the slaughter. They marked time
as the bands played, and they chatted together,
apparently quizzing us. I may here remark that
at my request the king released half of these men,
and that not one of them took the trouble to thank
me or to beg alms from me.</p>

<p>Hardly were we seated when Gelele, protected by
a gorgeous canopy umbrella, came forth from the
palace with Amazons and courtiers in a dense, dark
stream. Having visited his fetish gods, he greeted
us and retired to his seat under the normal shed.
As at Kana, his wives crowded together behind and
the soldieresses ranged themselves in front. The
ceremonies consisted of dancing, drumming, and distributing
decorations&mdash;&#8203;necklaces of red and yellow
beads. There was fearful boasting about feats of
past valour and bravery to come. About sunset the
king suddenly approached us, and I thanked him for
the spectacle. He then withdrew, and we lost no
time in following his example.</p>

<p>Nothing could be poorer than this display: any
petty Indian rajah can command more wealth and
splendour. All was barren barbarism, and the only
“sensation” was produced by a score of human beings
condemned to death and enjoying the death show.</p>

<p>On the morrow I sent a message to the palace,
officially objecting to be present at any human sacrifice,
and declaring that if any murder took place before me
I should retire to the coast. The reply was that few
were to be executed, that the victims would only be
<!--Page 243-->
malignant war captives and the worst of criminals, and
that all should be killed at night. With this crumb of
comfort I was compelled to rest satisfied. Hitherto
gangs of victims cruelly gagged had been paraded
before visitors, in whose hearing and often before
whose sight the murders were committed. Something
is gained by diminishing the demoralising prominence
of these death scenes. It is not so long ago since it
was determined that the “customs” of England should
be performed within the prisons, and not further debase
the mob of spectators.</p>

<p>The catastrophe took place on what is called the
“zan nya nyana,” or the evil night. At intervals we
heard the boom of the death-drum announcing some
horrible slaughter. It was reported that the king had
with his own hand assisted the premier-executioner.</p>

<p>On the next morning we were summoned to the
palace, whose approach was a horror. Four corpses,
habited in the criminal shirts and nightcaps, sat as
though in life upon the usual dwarf stools. The seats
were supported upon a two-storied scaffold made of
four rough beams, two upright and two horizontal,
and about forty feet high. On a similar but smaller
erection hard by were two victims, one above the other.
Between these substantial erections was a tall gallows of
thin posts, from which a single victim dangled by his
heels. Lastly, another framework of the same kind
was planted close to our path, and attached to the
cross-bar, with fine cords round the ankles and above
the knees, hung two corpses side by side and head
<!--Page 244-->
downwards. The bodies, though stiff, showed no signs
of violence: the wretches had probably been stifled.</p>

<p>At the south-eastern gate of the palace we found
freshly severed heads in two batches of six each,
surrounded by a raised rim of ashes. The clean-cut
necks were turned upwards, and the features were
not visible. Within the entrance were two more
heads; all the bodies had been removed, so as not to
offend the king.</p>

<p>Thus on Gelele’s “evil night” twenty-three human
beings had lost their lives. And this is but one act in
the fatal drama called the “customs.” It is said that
an equal number of women were slaughtered within
the walls of the royal abode, and I had every reason
to believe the report.</p>

<p>I was kept waiting more than a month in this den of
abominations before the king could enter upon public
affairs. He was discontented with the presents sent
from England, and he was preparing to attack a huge
Nago city&mdash;&#8203;Abeokuta&mdash;&#8203;where, by-the-bye, he was
signally defeated.</p>

<p>When my last visit to him took place he stubbornly
ignored, even in the least important matters, the wishes
of <abbr title="Her Majesty's">H.M.’s</abbr> Government. Filled with an exaggerated
idea of his own importance, and flattered almost to
madness by his courtiers, he proceeded to dictate his
own terms. His next thought was an ignoble greed
for presents. He bade me a friendly adieu, and asked
me to visit him next year with an English carriage and
horses, a large silk pavilion, and other such little gifts.
<!--Page 245-->
I refused to promise, and I resolved not to put my
head for the third time into the hyæna’s mouth. For
although Gelele has never shed the blood of a white
man, he might, at the bidding of his fetishers, send a
new kind of messenger to Ku-to-men by means of a
cup of coffee or a dish of meat. I was glad when I
found myself safely back in the pestilential climate of
Fernando Po.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent dropcap">BEFORE starting on an exploration into any
part of Africa (especially the West Coast), it is
essential that the traveller should be properly equipped
with the necessary kit both for the inward and outward
man. Clothing, blankets, and waterproofs of
every description; tea, coffee, and sugar if they be
desirable; a few bottles of real genuine cognac if
come-at-able, or some ten years’ old Jamaica rum if
attainable.</p>

<p>On the occasion of our starting from Fernando
Po in August 1863, for the purpose of ascending
the river Congo, our kit consisted of one bullock-trunk,
one small portable canteen, one dressing-bag,
two uniform-cases, one hat-box, one gun-case, one
tin box, one deal case of bread, one package of tins
of milk, one canteen of cooking utensils, one tin
of green tea, one ditto coffee, one small box of medical
comforts, etc., two striped bags, a white canvas
bag containing newspapers, three guns, two walking
<!--Page 250-->
sticks, one camp bed and mats, two revolvers, one
simpiesometer, a pocket azimuth, an instrument case,
one powder horn, one shot-bag and hunting ditto.
At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul de Loanda we added two cases of gin,
and at Point Banana twelve pieces of siamois, or
fancy cloths, twenty pieces riscados, or blue and white
stripe, and ten pieces satin stripe, besides six thousand
five hundred beads, china, and imitation corals. To
all this we afterwards received at Embomma fifteen
kegs of gunpowder and ten demijohns of rum.</p>

<p><abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship">H.M.S.</abbr> <span class="title">Torch</span> took us down to Loango Bay,
and there Captain Smith transferred us on board the
sloop-of-war <span class="title">Zebra</span>, Captain Hoskins, who in his
turn took us to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s and put us in the hands
of Captain Perry, of <abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship">H.M.S.</abbr> <span class="title">Griffon</span>, and this
latter vessel took us into the Congo; and forthwith
we commenced a start up the river on August
31st, 1863.</p>

<p>The usual mode of ascending the river up as far
as Embomma is by means of small fore and aft
schooners, generally from twenty to forty tons
measurement, which are heavily sparred and well supplied
with canvas. Our gear was taken by the <span class="title">Griffon’s</span>
boats and put on board the French schooner
<span class="title">Esperance</span>. We had a fine breeze that afternoon,
and the <span class="title">Esperance</span> sailed up the river most gallantly.
The party on board consisted of myself, Captain Perry,
Mr. Bigley, and Monsieur Pisseaux, a Frenchman;
besides William Dean, boatswain, my servant, four
French native soldiers, and the schooner’s crew.</p>

<p><!--Page 251-->
<span class="date">Wednesday, September 2nd.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We breakfasted at a
Portuguese factory, and soon after breakfast we
weighed anchor and sailed up the river, arriving
betimes at Porto da Lentra. In the afternoon we
left Porto da Lentra, and proceeded. Passed several
villages on the port hand. Boat got ashore several
times after dark. About nine o’clock the Missolongis
hailed and asked who we were. When I answered,
they said they would pay us a visit during the night.
We prepared to give them a warm reception. During
the night we rounded Point Devil, a most dangerous
place for navigation. Anchored at 10.30 p.m.</p>

<p><span class="date">Thursday, September 3rd.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Arrived at Embomma at
1.30 p.m. Embomma contained a French factory and
several Portuguese establishments. At 9.30 we got
under weigh again, and in about an hour afterwards
entered a part of the river where it assumes the
appearance of an inland lake, some parts nearly two
miles wide. The scenery here is varied, but principally
hilly, the highest of the hills being about 1,500 feet
above the level of the river. Here we met a native
chief in his canoe. He came to levy contributions
from us. His people, who were armed with guns and
hatchets, made various warlike gestures and ordered
us to stop. Monsieur Pisseaux being our guide and
adviser, we were compelled to pay one bottle of rum
and a piece of cloth twelve fathoms in length.</p>

<p>Captain Perry shot a fish-eagle, which was considered
a fine achievement, as very few of that species can
be shot on account of their inclination to fly high
<!--Page 252-->
in the air and to perch on the highest trees. About
three o’clock we landed to rest, the scenery still
bearing the same character, only perhaps the hills
were a little higher than those we had passed. The
grass was dry all over the hills (indeed, everywhere
except close to the water’s edge); and little animal
life being visible, the country had a very barren and
desolate appearance. The trees were not of much
consequence, and most of those we saw were stunted
and leafless. The chief were the baobab, or monkey
bread-fruit tree, the fan palm, or palmijra, a few
palm-nut trees, and a species of large spreading tree
well scattered over the water side. Its leaves were of
a dark green colour, about the size of the lime leaf;
its fruit, a long reddish plum, was said to be eaten
by monkeys, and also to be fit for human food.</p>

<p>Here was the farthest extent of Monsieur Pisseaux’s
knowledge of the river, and, to our future sorrow,
we landed in the banza, or district, of Nokki. We
cooked some food on shore, and messengers were
despatched with a bottle of gin to the king of Kayé.</p>

<p><span class="date">Tuesday, September 8th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We now left the river
for the interior, and found the road excessively irksome
and trying to our wind and legs; nothing but hills
and dales, the descents and ascents very difficult,
and stony withal, the soles of our feet receiving a
most disagreeable grating on small quartz and schistus.
Passing one or two fields of native beans, we arrived
at the village of Kindemba.</p>

<p>After resting here for a short time we again
<!--Page 253-->
started, and ascended a hill some six or seven hundred
feet in height, and came to another village, where we
saw something like a large baracoon for slaves, but
it turned out to be a fetish house for circumcised
boys.</p>

<p>Not many minutes’ walk from this was the
village of Kayé. On entering it we were marched
off to see the king. We found him seated in state,
dressed in a motley garb of European manufacture:
a white shirt with collar turned down, a crimson
velvet loin-cloth, fringed with gold and tied round
the waist by means of a belt, and a beautifully
mounted sheath-knife stuck in the belt. The handle
of the knife was made of nickel silver, and very
showily ornamented with imitation emeralds and ruby
garnets. Over all he wore a red beadle’s cloak,
and on his head a helmet somewhat resembling those
worn by English Life Guardsmen, but it was evidently
of French manufacture. The king was very young,
apparently not more than twenty years of age, very
smooth-faced, and looked quite shy when he came
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis-à-vis</i> with his illustrious visitors. When we were
all seated, I on a chair, and the others on a covered
table, the courtiers sat down on the ground at a
respectful distance. The king’s old father was seated
on the ground before his son.</p>

<p>The king’s name was Sudikil, and that of his father
Gidi Mavonga, both of them very bright specimens
of their race. After some compliments, Sudikil received
his presents&mdash;&#8203;one piece of fine fancy cloth and a
<!--Page 254-->
bottle of gin. The carriers received five bunches of
beads. But it appeared that the king was not satisfied
with his presents, and he would give us nothing
to eat. Therefore my companions, Captain Perry,
Dean, and Monsieur Pisseaux, at once started for the
river to return to Embomma. I, however, remained,
and engaged Nchama, a native who spoke African
idiomatic Portuguese, to act as interpreter and go-between.
I may here mention that our party when
it first started from the river consisted of fifty-six
persons, but it continued to augment until our arrival
at Kayé, when it mounted up to one hundred and
fifty. We were domiciled for the night in the house
of Siko Chico Mpambo, a man who put himself up
as a French interpreter, without even knowing one
personal pronoun of that language. In the evening
the rabble that pretended to have escorted our party
down to the canoe returned and requested some gin,
and I gave them a bottle. The prince likewise sent
for a bottle, which he received.</p>

<p><span class="date">Wednesday, September 9th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Early in the morning
we received a visit from Gidi Mavonga and his son
King Sudikil. They examined all our travelling-gear,
whilst my servant kept sentry at the door to prevent
their escort from going into the house. This consisted
of ten men, four of whom carried matchlocks.
After about half an hour’s palaver, everything was
handed over to Gidi, who promised to start for the
Congo in three days, and, in consideration of receiving
the said goods, bound himself to take us there, bring
<!--Page 255-->
us back, and feed us by the way. This arrangement
was a good one, as it secured the friendship of the
old chief and prevented him and his people from
robbing and poisoning us.</p>

<p>We later received a visit from Tetu Mayella, king
of an adjacent village called Neprat. He was accompanied
by about twenty followers, all of whom
came to us for the express purpose of getting
some rum. Tetu Mayella wrangled for two hours
with Gidi and another half-hour with Sudikil about
a bottle of grog, and ultimately despatched Nchama
to plead with me for him. I referred him back
to Gidi Mavonga, and, after a further consultation,
Tetu received one bottle of gin, in return for
which he came personally and presented us with two
fowls. This was a godsend, as the day before we
had nothing to eat but a few pieces of dry bread, and
water to wash it down. A pig was then slaughtered
with great ceremony. The carcass was cut up and
divided according to custom, the king getting the
lion’s share, and the other personages an allowance
in accordance with their rank. We made ready to
retire to rest after eating a good bush dinner and
drinking plenty of palm wine. Gidi Mavonga paid
us a visit late in the evening, and final arrangements
were made with him to proceed first to Yellalla, or
the Congo Cataracts, and afterwards to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Salvador,
or Great Gongo City.</p>

<p><span class="date">Thursday, September 10th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The direction of the
Yellalla Cataracts from the village of Kayé was
<!--Page 256-->
east-north-east, and that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Salvador, or Congo,
east-south-east. This morning we had dandelion
coffee for the fourth time. It was a most excellent
decoction, acting, when used judiciously, on the
liver and kidneys. We found that the natives
breakfasted on beans, ground nuts, fish, and beef
when it can be had, and the second course is a good
jorum of palm wine. At noon we began packing
up, in order to start for Gidi Mavonga’s village.
The natives of the Congo are divided into two classes
only, the mfumo, or freeman, and the muleque,
or slave. The mfumo marries amongst his own
slaves, or, properly speaking, retainers, and the
children born by him are in their turn mfumos, or
freemen. The word slave is here quite improperly
used, for the slave in reality is a freer man than
the king himself. Everything the king possesses,
except his wives, is literally at the disposal of the
slave. Unquestionably the slave is the bodyguard of
the mfumo, and, as regards work, he does what
he likes, sleeps when he chooses, attends to his
private affairs when he pleases, and if his master
finds fault with his conduct, the chances are, if his
own country be not too far away from the place
of his thraldom, he will leave his master and make
a bold effort to reach his native land.</p>

<p><span class="date">Friday, September 11th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Very early this morning
we were astonished by hearing a yelling noise from
a lot of women. To use a Scotch phrase, it was
a regular “skirl.” It so happened that a woman
<!--Page 257-->
was bearing a child, and these noises were made
either to drown the pains of labour or to welcome
the little stranger into his trouble. In any case,
we pitied the poor sufferer in travail, for the screeching
must have given her an awful headache.</p>

<p>Gidi Mavonga came to take us to his village of
Chingufu this morning. It was not a long journey,
we found. Gidi’s house was a facsimile of the one we
had left at Kayé: an oval building upheld by two
upright posts, and the roof supported by a long
stout beam laid on the top of, and tied to, the
uprights. The hut boasted of three doors, one at
each end and one at the side. Doubtless, fox-like,
the suspicious native makes all these doors to serve
as mediums of escape in case of war or a slave-hunt.
There was a partition in the centre dividing the hut
into two rooms, the first being a general room, and the
second the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</i>, accessible only to the
husband and wife. The furniture was very simple,
consisting of a native bed in each room. The walls
and roof were composed of bamboos and grass very
neatly tied together. There was no flooring but
the clay bottom, and the whole looked very clean
and simple.</p>

<p>Gidi appeared to be a great worshipper of the
native fetish Ibamba, or Nzamba, a variation of
the devil. The natives called him Masjinga, and
he is a house-god, usually keeping guard at the
bedsides. The idol in Gidi’s hut was a peculiarly
droll-looking object. He was an image about three
<!--Page 258-->
feet in height, with his mouth wide open, his under
lip hanging down, and the upper drawn up as if
by some strong convulsions, his nose flat as Africa,
and the nostrils very much inflated. His eyes were
composed of pieces of looking-glass, and in his
belly was inserted a penny mirror, but for what
purpose we could not discover. On his head was
an English billycock hat, and about his shoulders
were hung different kinds of medicines, a calabash,
and a knife. The face of this wonderful figure
was part black, part red, and part white. On the
walls of the house, and particularly about the bed,
were hung medicines, spells, and potions of every
description, supposed to be antidotes against every
evil to which the human frame is subject; medicines
to prevent gun-shots from taking effect, spells against
ill-luck, potions to have wives and plenty of children,
and, in fine, charms to protect against the wrath
and subtlety of Nzamba.</p>

<p>About midday we had a visit from some neighbouring
chiefs, all gaily attired. They wore red
nightcaps on their heads, and this was the only
head-dress I ever saw adopted by the men on
great occasions, Sudikil’s military helmet excepted.
The women always went bareheaded. I had often
wondered where in the wide universe old clothes
went to after they are purchased by the Jews in
London. The mystery was here solved, for I found
kings wearing second-hand livery suits, with the
coronet and crest of a marquis on the button, and
<!--Page 259-->
princes disporting themselves in marines’ jackets of
the last century, besides a variety of heterogeneous
habiliments, such as old superfine black coats which
had been worn threadbare, and pantaloons whose seats
had become quite glazed from long service. All
these had been cleaned and turned inside out by
the Jews; and, although some would scarcely bear
the tug of needle and thread, they were sent out
to the west coast of Africa as bran-new garments,
love of dress entirely blinding the natives to their
defects. Our visitors were regaled with palm wine
and a bottle of gin, and after laughing and talking
for a long time they went away.</p>

<p>About sunset we witnessed a native game, which
certainly was one of the liveliest sights since our start
up the river. A number of Gidi’s slaves assembled
in a large open space between the houses, and, dividing
themselves into two parties, began throwing a ball
from one to another. Upwards of twenty were
engaged in this game, and the fun consisted in the
one side dodging about in all directions, and preventing
its opponents from catching the ball by playing the
game into each others’ hands. The ball was made
of palm fibre tied round with a central fibre of the
plantain leaf. After sunset there was a wild country-dance,
which was kept up to a late hour.</p>

<p><span class="date">Saturday, September 12th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The chief Furano, who
was expected from Embomma, arrived the next
morning, and we started at once for the cataracts.
After marching for a short time and passing two or
<!--Page 260-->
three small villages, we commenced a descent in a
north-easterly direction, and, journeying at a rapid
pace for about three miles, we entered the village of
Chinsawu, the residence of Prince Nelongo. Arrived
at Nelongo’s, we were detained for about half an hour,
waiting in the verandah of an empty house, after which
we were honoured by the presence of the prince, who
intimated his pleasure to us by asserting that unless
the same presents as those given to Sudikil were
given to him, it would be impossible for us to pass
his place. This was preposterous, for we only stopped
to breakfast here, whereas we were four or five days
in the territory of Sudikil. It was remarkable that
nearly all the people in this region, from the prince
down to the smallest child, were diseased with the
itch. We observed them lying on the ground from
morning till night, with their skins so covered with
dust that a hippopotamus was a clean beast when
compared with these beings, who ranked in animate
nature as lords of creation.</p>

<p>We were comfortably housed at Nelongo’s village,
but Gidi and Nelongo were palavering all day, hammer
and tongs. I noticed at Nelongo’s village, as I did
in other places on the banks and neighbourhood of
the Congo, that all the children were afraid of the
white man, for when any person attempted to bring
them in proximity with me, the little brats howled as
if Satan from the infernal regions had got hold of
them. Most of the women were of the same texture
as their progeny.</p>

<p><!--Page 261-->
<span class="date">Sunday, September 13th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;After coffee this morning
all the great folks assembled in front of our house
and recommenced the half-finished palaver of last
evening. Council present: myself, Gida Mavonga,
Nelongo, Furano, Siko Npamba, and Interpreter
Nchama. All ended in talk, and Nchama threatened
to resign. The native idea of the riches possessed by
a white man is fabulous. Nelongo refused to believe
that we had not sufficient cloth with us to answer
his most exorbitant demands. We had a respectable
present for him; but that did not satisfy his avarice,
and he wanted more than we had taken with us for
the whole road. As there was another prince to
consult in the matter, it was agreed, at my suggestion,
that the whole of our gear should be submitted to
examination. The expected prince arrived, carried
on a hammock, and, after a heavy palaver and a
great deal of yelling from the women, he went
away; and then we had another visit from Nelongo,
who made some very noisy demonstrations, but as the
noise was conducted in the language of the country,
we were not able to understand a single syllable. Suffice
it to say that the whole affair ended by his receiving
an additional supply of cotton, not from us, but from
Gidi Mavonga. This Nelongo handed to one of his
armed slaves, and then went away; but he returned
again in about five minutes and intimated that the
palaver was all right, which caused Gidi and his men
to make demonstrations of approval by jumping up
and running some paces from the house and attacking
<!--Page 262-->
a supposed enemy. Then they returned to the house,
Furano holding the supposed wounded head of Gidi
Mavonga. But the truth must be told: the whole
batch of the debaters had got drunk on a mixture
of palm wine and Hollands. Hence the noise, which,
however, I did not allow to affect me, for I assumed
during the greater part of the row the most stoical
silence, and pretended to go to sleep. These tactics
were successful, and we were shortly afterwards
informed that we could depart in peace.</p>

<p>We were ready to start by twelve o’clock noon.
The sun was very hot, and the thermometer stood at
90° in the shade; but we were glad to get out of
a place which reminded us of Bedlam, and therefore
set out in all haste, making a slight descent into a
valley, and then ascending a peculiarly formed hill,
the perpendicular height of which might be a hundred
and fifty feet, and from whose summit we obtained a
glorious view of the river, which was seen some eight
hundred feet below us, flowing down rapidly and
majestically to the sea. But the utter barrenness of the
country in the vicinity of its banks carried away every
association of fertility. This view of the country,
however, is given at the end of the dry season, when
almost every tree loses its leaves, and the green grass
becomes withered and dried up.</p>

<p>From this point we began a decline down hill which
beggars description. We had not walked above a
quarter of a mile before we arrived at a part of our
road where, without the least exaggeration, the path,
<!--Page 263-->
if such it could be called, was only two degrees from
the perpendicular, and as slippery as ice, owing to the
loose stones and dry grass that created a stumbling-block
for the feet, and we had frequently to descend
sitting instead of walking down. Alpine and Vesuvian
mountaineers, do try the banks of the Congo.</p>

<p>The distance from Nelongo’s village to the banks
of the river was about five miles, and on reaching
the water-side we found ourselves exactly at the
junction of the Nomposo with the Congo River. The
Nomposo, we were informed, extended all the way to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Salvador, but was not navigable, even for canoes.
There were some fishermen who followed their vocation
at the mouth of this small river, whose services were
soon brought into requisition to take us across the
Nomposo and land us a little above its mouth, but
on the bank of the great river. This landing was
the place where the fishermen dried their fish, and
was called Munyengi Asiko. Being heartily tired,
we very gladly sat down, and ultimately got ourselves
ready to pass the night in the open air, not for the
first time. Just about sunset this evening we were
visited by one of those nasty drizzling showers, commonly
called a Scotch mist. In about an hour it
increased to a smart shower; but, luckily, we were
well provided with good waterproof sheets and coats,
so that no harm happened to the gear or to ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="date">Monday, September 14th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Great excitement this
morning, having on the previous night lost my tablets
of daily memoranda. An offer of four fathoms of
<!--Page 264-->
cloth was made to any person who would recover the
same and return them to their owner. The whole
batch of carriers and fishermen were instantly hard
at work trying to find the missing tablets. After
twenty minutes’ search they were found in Captain
Tuckey’s book on the Congo.</p>

<p>Another row amongst the natives. It appears
that some two days previously a man had supplied
another with two jars of palm wine upon condition
of his receiving some fish in return. The unlucky
fisherman, after drinking the wine, did not succeed
in catching fish for two days, and consequently was
unable to pay his debt. Hence the high words and
brandishing of hatchets on the part of the wine merchant
and his people. But that was all; no blows were
struck, for the dog that barks very loud seldom bites.</p>

<p>It is always advisable in travelling through Africa
to keep guides and interpreters ignorant of your
possessions, for they are sure to make some excuse
or other to fleece you. This morning we had evidence
of this. We had paid our guide everything that
was necessary for the road, yet he sent the interpreter
to ask us for a piece of fancy cloth which he knew
I had. I had to grant his request, otherwise I might
have had to give up the journey, for ten chances to
one he would have left me in a huff.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock we crossed the river, the time
occupied being a quarter of an hour. We reached the
village of Vivi after half an hour’s march; distance, one
and a half miles. Nesalla was the name of the king
<!--Page 265-->
at Vivi; he spoke Portuguese and dressed plainly.
One of his attendants, however, wore a hussar’s
jacket. Nesalla sent three bunches of plantains and
seven fowls for the expedition. At twelve o’clock I
washed, more or less in public, and, in the meantime,
the women and children performed a grigri for
goodness to be bestowed on their town and prince.
One of the children beat on a long native drum,
another performed on a native whistle attached to
an image of Diabolus, and the women used their
tongues very freely. It was a horrid din.</p>

<p>About two o’clock Nesalla came with upwards of
one hundred men and commenced a long palaver about
our going on to Yellalla. Five or six persons spoke,
and the conference lasted one hour. The conclusion
showed that the cloth we had with us was not enough,
and that the princes at Yellalla must get a different
piece from that which was before the conference, and
no division into two pieces must be made of it under
any consideration whatever. As the whole affair was
conducted in a most good-humoured manner, I agreed
to the terms.</p>

<p>In the evening the inhabitants of the village had
a dance. Those who have witnessed the Spanish
cachucha need scarcely be told what this dance was.
The cachucha is a very good dance in its way; but
the Congo dance beats it hollow, because it has more
pith in it than the cachucha. The fun was kept up
till a late hour, every one, both great and small,
young and old, joining in it, so that in the end, what
<!--Page 266-->
with palm wine and excitement, the people became
quite unruly, and when they left off the babel of
tongues was unbearable. They came to our quarters,
aroused us out of our sleep by opening the door and
very unceremoniously pulling our clothes from us.
They wanted some sort of covering, and thinking we
might be kind enough to let them have something,
took the liberty of taking without asking. We could
not, however, submit to this. We permitted old Gidi
Mavonga to sleep in the house, and turned the rest
out of doors.</p>

<p><span class="date">Tuesday, September 15th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Early this morning we
started for the Banza Nculu. The scenery along the
road was varied and picturesque. The first view we
had of the river was from an eminence about a mile
from Vivi on the road to the Banza Nculu. Here
we had a view of the Congo as it was flowing onwards,
and round about in all directions were hills and dales
adding a panoramic beauty to the scene. We had
to descend from the summit of the first hill and ascend
a second one much higher than the first, and from
here we again obtained views of the Congo. One,
the lower view, appeared like a lake, apparently shut
in on all sides by hills, whose lofty summits stretched
far and wide on every side, and some of them peered
to the height of above a thousand feet into the heavens.
Proceeding onwards, we ascended a third eminence,
but by this time we had lost sight of the river, and
our path became more level for a short distance.</p>

<p>We now commenced a gradual descent, but before
<!--Page 267-->
doing so we obtained an open and extensive view
of the valley that lay between us and the Banza Nculu.
On descending into the valley, we found the soil
a dark clay mould with fewer stones on it than on
that of the country through which we had hitherto
passed. It was certainly a fine sight to behold, and
the best addition to the scene was the caravan which
formed the expedition now disappearing down a valley,
now rising to the top of one of the many hillocks
with which the valley abounded. The fertility of the
soil may be observed here from the fact of the grass
growing to the height of ten or twelve feet, and here
also the native beans grow to a greater height than
did those we saw in other parts of the country. In
the valley we crossed three streams of running water,
all feeders of the big river; and considering that it
was the latter end of the dry season, these streams
all had a fair supply of water.</p>

<p>We now arrived at the summit of the hill of the
Banza Nculu, and as the three kings and three interpreters
could not be seen at once, in consequence
of their having first to settle some palaver about fish,
we were compelled to bivouac under a large tree in
the environs of Nculu until their highnesses might
condescend to give us an audience. We breakfasted
under the large tree, and were amused before and after
breakfast by a number of urchins (say eight or ten)
who had undergone the ceremony of circumcision, and
who delighted in making a churring noise&mdash;&#8203;a ch-u-r-r
decidedly intended to frighten us into hysterics. But
<!--Page 268-->
our nerves were stronger than they at first imagined,
and I went up to them and complimented them on
their performance. The dress of these youths was a
crinoline made of palm leaves, extending from their
armpits down to their knees, or a little below that.
Their arms, neck, and face were chalked white, and
one of them had on a mask representing a white
man with whiskers. The performance of this mask
was admirably wild and laughable.</p>

<p>About two o’clock one of the three interpreters
came to see us. He was dressed in a trade shirt and
red nightcap, and was accompanied by a few men
only, and had merely come to show us to a house.</p>

<p>At half-past three we heard the beating of a drum
and cone, and, on looking out at the door, saw a
procession making its way to the house in which
we were lodged. I was already seated at the door,
and, the whole cavalcade coming up, they seated
themselves around the front of the house in a semicircle.
Altogether there might have been about two
hundred and fifty persons, including all sexes and
sizes. Three ministers belonging to the three kings
were the principal personages, and had come as
ambassadors for their masters. One of them had
already given his opinion in a refusal to permit me
to pass on to Sundi, and it now remained for the
whole council to arrive at the ultimate decision of
Yes or No. The first conference assembled and
broke up in a very short time. The beginning
appeared favourable, for the ministers retired amidst
<!--Page 269-->
the noise of drum and cone. The latter is an iron
musical instrument peculiar to the country, and when
played sounds exactly like the triangle of the
Ethiopian serenaders. When they had reached the
palaver tree we heard a great yelling among the
populace, which showed that they were satisfied. In
a very short time they returned again to the house
and waited till I had finished dinner, and then
demanded the presents for themselves and their royal
masters. As usual they were not satisfied; but we
had no more to give them, and Furano, our interpreter,
took one of the ministers into the house and
showed him all our gear. A grunt from the minister
announced to us that he saw it was impossible to
get “blood out of a stone.”</p>

<p>They went away, and the third conference took
place at four o’clock. This was the Grand Council,
and there were plenty who spoke, the upshot of
the whole affair being that they ultimately demanded
the moderate sum of £300 in cloth, beads, and liquor,
giving us permission (on our agreeing to the foregoing
terms) to go on to Sundi above the cataracts, a journey
occupying only three days. “Impudence is better
than modesty,” but we thought this was carrying
impudence to a pitch. This sum was out of the
question, and had we been possessed of enough to
answer the demands of those bushmen, rather than
acquiesce, we should certainly have preferred throwing
the amount into the “Slough of Despond.”</p>

<p><span class="date">Wednesday, September 16th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;This morning we went
<!--Page 270-->
to view the rapids. We found that the Yellalla Rapids
ran east-north-east and west-south-west, and might
be said to be about a mile in length. They were
assuredly very grand, although the natives led us
to expect something grander still. Some fishermen
were busy catching fish up and down the quieter
part of the rapids, whilst the eagles and cranes were
satisfying their hunger in the vicinity of the island
of Sanga-chya-Malemba in the middle of the stream,
some hundred yards from either side of the river’s
banks.</p>

<p>All day Gidi Mavonga was very stubborn and
irritable, and wished to start at once for Vivi and
return home; but as I had to put up some botanical
specimens, to finish two sketches of this part of the
country, and besides, having sore feet from walking,
I would not hear of starting. Gidi therefore started,
after repeated palavers, and called his muleks to
follow him: some followed; others begged off, but
to no purpose. Off he went, and after proceeding
a short distance, returned, and in very strong words
expressed himself an injured man. This was taking
high ground; I therefore told the interpreter to tell
Gidi that he might go away, and, at the same time,
to inform him that he must send certain properties
belonging to me which had been left at his banza,
and that in future no further communication would
be held with his place by any Englishman.</p>

<p>Gidi said that the property belonged to him. I
told him to take all, but, he might rely upon it,
<!--Page 271-->
the kings who live close to the riverside would have
to answer for the things. Whereupon Gidi at once
gave way, and most submissively begged pardon, and
matters were set right for a short time.</p>

<p><span class="date">Saturday, September 19th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We found ourselves
back again at Gidi Mavonga’s village, paying off all
the extra hands who accompanied us to the rapids.
The pay was made in cloth, beads, and liquors.</p>

<p>The heavy demands made by the bigwigs of Banza
Nculu&mdash;&#8203;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr></i> £300 for mere permission to pass to
Sundi, beside the enormous expense of feeding ourselves
and thirty-five followers&mdash;&#8203;had compelled us
to give up the project we had in view, especially as
we had seen the principal rapids on the river&mdash;&#8203;the
rest of the falls, until reaching Sundi, being mere
elevations, in themselves quite insignificant. My
object had been to reach Sundi, and thence try to
ascertain the course of the river, and to find out
whether its source could be nearly reached by canoes,
or entirely reached by carriers. But finding the
demands of the chiefs beyond my power of compliance,
I resolved to return. Our chief guide, Gidi Mavonga,
was anxious to make a retrograde movement as
quickly as possible, and urged upon us the necessity
of packing up and starting after three o’clock on
the afternoon of our return from visiting the rapids.
But I declined to stir until the next morning, and
after much trouble I gave him and his slaves one
blanket cloth and a pair of razors, which quieted
him a little. But it was soon evident that even this
<!--Page 272-->
munificent gift merely banked up the fires of discord
in the breasts of the savages, for the same dissatisfaction
was observable even after we returned
to their village. The day of settlement brought
Gidi and his slaves to our temporary residence, and
what followed beggared powers of description. What
uproar! What threats! What runnings to and
fro! All the devils in the infernal regions appeared
to have infused a double portion of their diabolical
influence into the bodies and souls of their willing
disciples on that day of settlement, and when everybody’s
fury had reached the climax of rage and insolence,
old Gidi rushed into the house occupied by
us, commenced turning all our gear upside down, and
at last laid forcible hands upon a bale of merchandise.</p>

<p>I therefore quietly informed the wild old man that
he was carrying matters too far, asked the meaning
of it, and took out a six-barrelled Colt’s revolver, and
placed it at my feet ready for use in case of need.
This had the desired effect, for Gidi, after taking a
long, covetous look at the bale of merchandise, turned
round and stared at the leveller of six men at my feet,
and having balanced the difference, he slunk out in
perfect silence, followed by his two myrmidons, who
had accompanied their master into the house to carry
away anything that their lord might select. Outside
the slaves still clamoured, and at last induced their
master to beard me again when I was writing.</p>

<p>Thus for two days affairs progressed as hot as fire
and as irritating as a wife’s bad temper, till at length,
<!--Page 273-->
by some special interposition of Providence, we managed
to make arrangements for some people to carry our
gear down to the riverside, and for a canoe to take
us to Embomma, one of the principal stations on the
river.</p>

<p>The preliminaries of this arrangement occupied two
days, and on the morning of the third day we were
ready to start by half-past five o’clock, but no carriers
had as yet made their appearance, and after they did
come, it was with the same infernal noise that we
managed to start them with the loads. But the moment
they were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> they almost ran with the things,
and shortly disappeared from our view. We followed
as quickly as we could after them, and arriving at
Kayé, a sentinel with a gun stopped us, and informed
us that his Highness Prince Sudikil desired our
presence. On reaching the house of our old landlord,
we discovered the whole of our gear before his door,
and the prince with his mother and some of his slaves
standing in a circle round the things, whilst one disgusting-looking
brute was about to open a box of
beads. I at once walked up to the rascal and gave
him a castigation with a stick. The fellow looked
daggers; but on showing him a fine breech-loading
Cooper’s rifle, he held down his head and slunk a
little way back from the box and sat down.</p>

<p>And now commenced a palaver between the prince
and myself, the substance of which was that the
prince wished to exact more presents from me, but
this time by force. The armed slaves began to come
<!--Page 274-->
up one by one, until they added a considerable number
to the crowd. I told the prince that it was customary
to give on the arrival but not on the departure of
a stranger. But as his highness persisted in his inflexible
determination to have something, I referred him
to Mambuka Prata, a powerful chief at Embomma, and
requested Sudikil to take and keep my signet ring until
the case was settled by arbitration at head-quarters.</p>

<p>At this suggestion the prince, his mother, some
of the slaves, and even Nchama, our interpreter,
commenced such a babel of tongues that we wished
the whole bunch of them keeping company with
Pharaoh at the bottom of the Red Sea. It was
quite evident that they had perceived the absurdity
and obstinacy of their covetous desires. The prince
therefore walked away in a great rage, taking with
him all his slaves, and nearly one-half of those who
had brought our kit from his father’s house. Here,
again, was another fix. We were standing pondering
over the peculiar position in which we were placed,
when luckily the few who remained at once resolved
to carry each a double load, and this brought us to
the waterside, and examining all our baggage, and
seeing everything correct, I made a present of beads
to the carriers and had breakfast.</p>

<p>By 9.45 a.m. we set off for Embomma with
thankfulness, where we arrived at 5 p.m. on the
same day, having run down with the current, slightly
assisted by paddles, a distance of forty-five miles in
seven hours and a quarter.</p>

<p><!--Page 275-->
<span class="date">Wednesday, September 23rd.</span>&mdash;&#8203;John Clarke, being
engaged to go with us to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Salvador, started this
afternoon with Nchama to bring carriers from
Mambuka Prata. Chief Mambuka Prata had a few
trading huts close to the French factory, where he
flew a black and white flag on trading occasions.
The district of Embomma may extend about eight
or ten miles in length, and throughout the whole of
it villages of from ten to twenty houses may be seen
standing in all directions, and sometimes several miles
apart from one another. The king’s residence may
consist of sixty houses, and it is generally at the royal
villages that the traveller finds a home during his
sojourn.</p>

<p><span class="date">Thursday, September 24th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;At Embomma. This
day’s proceedings have been more annoying than any
that have preceded it. The two messengers, John
Clarke and Nchama, who had been sent on a mission
to Mambuka Prata, returned without having accomplished
a single order in connection with the mission
entrusted to them. Nchama returned about six o’clock
in the morning, perfectly drunk, and incapable of
giving a single word of explanation as to his whereabouts
and doings. John Clarke returned in the
afternoon, and gave rather a tame version of his
proceedings. He said that Mambuka Prata, being
annoyed at not receiving a coat promised him by
Monsieur Pisseaux, would not send any carriers to
take us on to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Salvador. What a Frenchman’s
conduct had to do with an Englishman’s affairs I
<!--Page 276-->
could not conceive. He (Mambuka Prata) said the
carriers would not be forthcoming until he received
a book from the white man, or saw him himself.
This last sounded like a falsehood, as there was not a
soul in all Vinda who could read a single scrap, and,
besides, our interpreters took with them a very good
book in the shape of a demijohn of rum and a tenth
of powder, but whether these had been delivered
into the hands of the proper persons was a question.
Nchama, having been severely reprimanded, repaired to
his village, and did not make his appearance again
until the day we left Embomma.</p>

<p><span class="date">Friday, September 25th.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We left Embomma, and
arrived in Porto da Lentra at 1.15 on the morning
of Saturday, September 26th. On the way down
the canoemen made several attempts to land at various
villages, but were forced to proceed for fear of Colt’s
revolvers. They did very well, and received six
bottles of rum.</p>

<p>We left Porto da Lentra for Point Banana at
4.15 on the morning of September 27th. We had
exchanged our smaller but fine canoe for a large one,
and started with six hands and captain, but had
scarcely lost sight of Porto da Lentra when our canoemen
went up a creek&mdash;&#8203;they said to get extra clothing.
We were detained more than half an hour waiting
for them, until probably they had eaten their breakfast
and drunk their palm wine. We got them to start
with great difficulty; but at the very next creek they
stopped again, and would have repeated the dose at
<!--Page 277-->
other places had we not had recourse to our friends
in need, the revolvers.</p>

<p>At the creek one man jumped on shore and we
pushed off again; but a few yards down we were
hailed by a Missolongi canoe, the river-pirates of
this part of the Congo. This third time our canoemen
stopped; and we were obliged to face them
with cocked revolvers and compel them to go on.
Down we glided, assisted more by the current than
by our men. Another creek, and the canoemen
requested to stop again to eat, which request was
positively refused.</p>

<p>The river had been hitherto very calm, but at two
o’clock the sea-breeze began to blow hard; the tide
was also slightly against us, and this caused a swell
in the river which wetted nearly all our things. I
was surveying at the time, and, fearing that the instruments
might get a soaking with salt water, I
ordered the canoemen to put back and return to Point
Banana by means of a creek on the right of the river.
This appeared to the canoemen to be awfully hard
work, although they had only to pull back for about
a quarter of a mile. The Congoes are remarkable
for their uselessness: they excel in eating, drinking,
sleeping, and talking, in a word, in satisfying their
sensual comforts, and what little sense they have is
used for the purpose of annoying those with whom
they come in contact. More than five times they
were asked to make sail, and then gave a few strokes
with their paddles, and stopped and chatted again, put
<!--Page 278-->
the canoe broadside on to the billows, let her drift
back, and again gave a few more strokes.</p>

<p>In this way nearly an hour passed away, and we
never reached the end of the quarter-mile. They
began to complain that the way by the creek was
too far, whilst just a short time before that they told
us the creek was the nearest. They now declared
that they could proceed no farther, and pulled the
canoe in shore. Seeing that the whole bevy of them,
from the captain to the small boy, were all drunk
from drinking some rum they had brought with
them, we could do nothing but submit to this state
of things, anything being preferable to trusting the
canoe with a lot of drunken hands, and getting ourselves
and gear saturated with salt water.</p>

<p>The crew were permitted to land. They lighted a
fire, cooked, ate, drank, quarrelled, and went to sleep.
The padron, or captain, took possession of the rum,
and drank himself to sleep also; and when the wind
abated a little and the water became calmer, we
awakened the captain with difficulty, and he with
greater difficulty his crew; but the tide had gone
down, and the canoe was high and dry on the bank.
All efforts to launch her into the water proved
unavailing, especially as the rum was still hard at
work, and what little sense the Congoes had was
perfectly misapplied. In consequence we had to
wait until the tide again served, which did not take
place till two o’clock the following morning, when
we tried again to start our hands, and with great
<!--Page 279-->
delay and noise managed to reach Point Banana
at 4.15 a.m.</p>

<p>At six o’clock all our things were landed and
comfortably housed within Monsieur Parrat’s factory.
Thank God! we were now at a considerable distance
from Yellalla and the triumvirate and avaricioua
triple ministers of the Banza Nculu, far away from
the Banza Vivi and its king, far away from the
quarrelsome, covetous, gin-drinking, noisy, and licentious
old Gidi Mavonga, far away from that senseless
nincompoop the Prince Sudikil, and&mdash;&#8203;praise be to

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><span class="title">THE INTERIOR OF BRAZIL</span></h3>

<h4 class="h4head">1867</h4>

<p class="p2 unindent dropcap">I &thinsp;HAD been in Brazil nearly two years, vegetating
between Santos and São Paulo, varied by an
occasional expedition afield or a trip to Rio de Janeiro,
when I determined to put into action my long-cherished
plan of prospecting the great and wealthy province of
Minas Gerães in the interior, and then to go down the
São Francisco, which is the Brazilian Mississippi, from
Sabará to the sea, and to visit <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> the Paulo
Affonso rapids, the Niagara of Brazil. As my wife
was very anxious to go, I took her with me.</p>

<p>We left Rio on June 12th, 1867, and sailed
across the incomparable Bay, and then ascended to
Petropolis. From Petropolis we made our real start
in a large char-à-banc, which held eight, in two and
two, and which was drawn by four mules. The mules
started off in fine style; being fresh and frisky they
simply galloped along the mountain side. It is not
necessary for me to describe the first part of the journey,
which, for a few days, travelled along a well-known
road, through a splendid district of wooded mountains,
broad rivers, and boulders of rock; the vegetation
was especially fine, even tropical. At Juiz de Fora
<!--Page 284-->
we abandoned our char-à-banc for the coach, whereby
we travelled to Barbacena, and here again we left the
coach for the saddle, and followed the bridle-road, if
indeed it could be called a road.</p>

<p>I should weary if I were to describe the places we
passed through until we came to Logão Duroda, where
the railway was in process of making, and where they
were just laying the first chain for the exploration of
the mountains and for the prolongation of the Dom
Pedro Secunda Railway. There was an inauguration
ceremony, and my wife had the honour of giving the
first blow to the stock and breaking a bottle of wine
over it. After that we had a convivial gathering, and
wound up with a dinner in the good old English
fashion. Next day we started off again, and still riding
through beautiful scenery, up and down mountains,
through shallow rivers and bits of virgin forests, from
day to day, we eventually arrived at Morro Velho,
where we were most hospitably received by the superintendent
of the São Goa d’el Rey Mining Company
and Mrs. Gordon, and we spent some days in their
most comfortable home. Morro Velho is the queen
of the Minas Gerães mines, and a most interesting
place, but, as we were going back to it, we determined
to press on to Ouro Preto, which is the capital of the
province, a most hilly town, for walking up and down
the streets was as difficult as climbing up ladders.
We stayed here two days, and then returned to Morro
Velho. We had a long, muddy, rainy journey on the
way back, slipping backward two steps for every one
<!--Page 285-->
forward, but at last we arrived at the Gordons’ house
again, and were warmly welcomed as before. Here
we tarried for a fortnight, and thoroughly explored
everything.</p>

<p>Among other things we explored the mine, which
had the reputation of being the largest, deepest, and
richest gold-mine in Brazil. My wife determined
to go with me, and Mrs. Gordon, who had never
before ventured under grass, kindly consented to
accompany her. Mr. Gordon and I went down first
in a bucket, or kibble, which was suspended over the
abyss. We found in it a rough wooden seat, comfortable
enough. We were advised by the pitman
not to look downwards, as the glimmer of the sparks
and lights below was apt to cause giddiness and seasickness.
I did look down and felt none the worse.
We touched and tilted half over once against a cableway
drum, but that was our only contretemps.
I could not but wonder at the mighty timbering
which met my eyes as it dilated in the darkness;&mdash;&#8203;timber
everywhere, all of the best and hardest wood.
The mighty mass, it might hardly be said, was not
without flaws, very palpable at second look. We
made an easy descent down the shaft, and a bunch
of lighted tow, tied to the bucket chain, showed us
all its features. There was no “rattle his bones over
the stones,” and the drop lasted fifteen minutes. At
the bottom the kibble, or bucket, stood still, began
to reel like a boat, and descended perpendicularly
until we stepped out. Presently Mrs. Gordon and
<!--Page 286-->
my wife, habited in brown holland trousers, belted
blouses, and miners’ caps, came down, delighted with
the kibble travelling. The men did everything to
banish the ladies’ alarm, and spoke and cheered us
as we passed. The mine was utterly new to me,
and most unlike the dirty labyrinth of little clefts
and filthy galleries down which I have often crawled
like a low reptile; the height suggested a cavern
or a huge stone-quarry.</p>

<p>Candle burning, the usual test, detected nothing
abnormal in the atmosphere; the ventilation was
excellent. Of course, our feet were wiped, and,
physically speaking, they wanted wiping; the floor
was wet, the mud was slippery, and locomotion somewhat
like an ascent of the Pyramids, although the
ground was pretty level.</p>

<p>It was a huge palace of darkness; the walls were
either black as the grave, or reflected in the slender
rays of light a watery surface, or were broken into
monstrous projections, half revealing and half concealing
cavernous recesses. Despite the lamps, the
night pressed upon us, as it were, with a weight, and
the only measure of distance was a spark here and
there, glimmering like a single star. Distinctly nerve-testing
was the gulf between the huge mountain
sides, apparently threatening every moment to fall.
Through this Inferno gnomes glided about in a
ghostly fashion, half-naked figures enveloped by the
mist. Here dark bodies hung by chains in what
seemed frightful positions; there they swung like
<!--Page 287-->
leopards from place to place; there they swarmed
up loose ropes like troglodytes; there they moved
over scaffolding, which even to look up at would
make a nervous temperament dizzy.</p>

<p>Our visit to the mine amply repaid us; it was a
place</p>

<p class="center small">Where thoughts were many, and words were few.</p>

<p class="unindent">But the fact will remain on our mental retina as
long as our brains will do their duty.</p>

<p>After a fortnight at Morro Velho I prepared to go
to Sabará, there to embark <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to the coast. With
a peculiar cat-like feeling I bade adieu to the Gordons,
with whom we had found an English home in the
Highlands of Brazil. My excellent compatriots,
however, accompanied me to break the shock of
departure; my wife also, though, as she had sprained
her ankle badly, she was to return to Rio.</p>

<p>It was a long ride from Morro Velho and a tiring
one, and we were glad to enter the picturesque city
of Sabará, where we found tolerable lodgings. Here
I completed my preparations for descending the
Rio das Velhas, and had to seek the aid of a store-keeper,
who turned out to be an extortioner. That,
perhaps, was only to be expected; but I may justly
complain when, in addition to his extortionate charges,
he sent me down the river, a river like the Mississippi,
in a raft whose starboard canoe had a leak scarcely
stopped up with Sabará clay.</p>

<p>The next day we all walked down to the upper
landing-place, where the ajojo, or raft, lay. I never
<!--Page 288-->
saw such an old Noah’s ark, with its standing
awning, a floating gipsy “pal,” some seven feet
high and twenty-two long, and pitched like a tent
upon two hollowed logs. The river, I thought,
must indeed be safe if this article can get down
without an accident.</p>

<p>All the notables of the place witnessed the process
of embarkation. A young English lady broke a bottle
of wine with all possible grace upon the bows, and
duly christened the craft the <span class="title">Eliza</span> and two pairs
of slippers were thrown at my head. Many <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivas</i>
were given and returned, and all my party embarked
for a trial trip of a couple of miles. <a name="rapids" id="rapids"></a>When the fifteen
souls came on board, they sank the raft some three
palms, and deluged the upper platform, making the
headman, or pilot, very nervous; already he began
to predict swamping, “going down in a jiffey,” and
being dashed to pieces by the rapids. We shot past
a dangerous rock in mid-stream, and in a short time
arrived at the little village of Santo Antonio da Roça
Grande, where animals were waiting to carry home
the non-voyagers, my wife included. They landed
here, but stood as the setting sun sank behind the
mountains and waved their farewells as they watched
the raft turn the last corner and float off into the
far mysterious unknown. I confess to having felt an
unusual sense of loneliness as the kindly faces faded
away in the distance, and, by way of distraction, I
applied myself to a careful examination of my raft.</p>

</div>
<!--Page 290--><!--Blank Page-->

<p><!--Page 291-->
The ajojo, or, as it is called in other places, the
“balsa,” here represents the flat boat of the Mississippi.
On the Rio das Velhas, however, it had not yet become
an institution, and at that time I was the only traveller
who had yet passed down by it from Sabará to the
rapids of Paulo Affonso. I need not describe it in
detail; I will only say that, though not of the
safest description, it behaved itself, under all the
circumstances, well.</p>

<p>My crew numbered three&mdash;&#8203;old Vieira and his sons.
Two stood in the bows with poles, which they
preferred as being easier to use than paddles. The
paddles used in deep waters vary in shape every few
hundred miles. The men were mere landlubbers;
they felt, or affected to feel, nervous at every obstacle.
They had been rowing all their lives, and yet they
knew not how to back water; curious to say, this
was everywhere the case down stream. They pulled
with all their might for a few minutes when the
river was rapid, so as to incur possible risks, and
when the water was almost dead, they lay upon their
oars and lazily allowed themselves to be floated down.
Thus, during the working day, between 7 a.m. and
5 p.m., very little way was made. They had no
system, nor would they learn any. The only thing
energetic about them was the way they performed
upon the cow-horn, and with this they announced
arrival, saluted those on the banks, and generally
enjoyed the noise.</p>

<p>My first stage was between Sabará and Santa Lusia.
The stream was deeply encased; the reaches were short,
<!--Page 292-->
and we seemed to run at the bluffs, where high ribs
came down to the bed and cut the bottom into very
small bends. The most troublesome feature was the
shallow places where the bed broadened; we grounded
with unpleasant regularity. This part also abounded
in snags. The tortuous bed, never showing a mile
ahead, prevented anything like waves, though the
wind was in our teeth. At this time of year we saw
the Old Squaw’s River at its worst; there was a
minimum of water and a maximum of contrary wind.
On the other hand, it was the “moon of flowers”;
the poor second growth teemed with bunches of
purple beauty, and the hill-tops were feathered by
palms.</p>

<p>At Jaguára the people cried, “You’ll never reach
Trahiras,” deriding the <span class="title">Eliza</span>. Indeed, we seemed
likely to waste much time. However, we crept on
surely, if slowly. As evening approached the weather
waxed cool and clear, and the excessive evaporation
gave the idea of great dryness; my books curled up, it
was hardly possible to write, and it reminded me of
the Persian Gulf, where water-colours cannot be used
because the moisture is absorbed from the brush.</p>

<p>The first view of Santa Lusia was very pleasing;
a tall ridge about a mile from the stream was capped
with two double-towered churches, divided by fine,
large, whitewashed houses and rich vegetation, with
palms straggling down to the water. Here I landed
and made my way to the hotel, which was a most
tumble-down hole, and after supper inspected Santa
<!--Page 293-->
Lusia. It was formerly a centre of the gold diggings,
but at this time possessed nothing of interest.</p>

<p>The next morning was delicious, and the face of
Nature was as calm as if it could show no other expression.
The sword-like rays of the sun, radiating from
the unseen centre before it arose in its splendour, soon
dispersed the thin mists that slept tranquilly upon the
cool river-bed. We shot the Ponte Grande de Santa
Lusia to Cruvello and the backwoods. The bridge
was the usual long, crooked affair, with twelve trusses,
or trestles, in the water and many outside, showing
that the floods are here extensive. The girders are
rarely raised high enough, and an exceptional inundation
sweeps them away, leaving bare poles bristling in the
bed and dangerous piles under water.</p>

<p>About two miles below Santa Lusia the water became
deeper and the country changed. The right, or
eastern, side was rough and hilly, with heights hugging
the bed. Near the other bank the land was more
level, and the soil showed a better complexion, by
which both sugar-cane and timber profited. In
another hour we sighted the first cotton plantation,
and right well it looked. There was indeed a mine
of neglected wealth in cotton and fish along, and in,
this river, and the more I saw of it the richer I found
it. The hills were clothed with thin brown-grey
grass, looking in places as if they were frosty with
hoar, and always profusely tasselled.</p>

<p>Presently another bend showed certain white lines
between the river-fringe of trees, and this was the
<!--Page 294-->
abode of the friaresses. We made fast to a gap in
the clay bank and landed. At first I was refused
even coffee, and there was no inn. I therefore
sent my card and letter to the reverend vicar,
and he at once called upon me, ordered dinner,
and took me off to see the lions, of which the
most interesting was the sisterhood, or infirmary,
of the friaresses before named. The reverend
mother, rather a pretty person, received us at the
door, kissed the padre’s hand, and led the way to
the little college chapel, white and gold with frescoed
ceiling. We visited the dormitories; the galleries were
long, the room was large and airy. The infirmary
contained one sister and four invalid girls. The
thirty-six reverend women were dressed in white
veils and petticoats, with black scapulars in front,
and over all a blue cloak. I spent the night at this
place on the raft; the moon and stars were unusually
bright, and the night was delightfully clear and cool.</p>

<p>We set out next morning at seven o’clock, and
proceeded without much adventure all that day and
night, finally arriving at Jaguára, at which hospitable
place I spent pleasant days, whilst another crew was
engaged and arrangments for my reaching Diamantina
were being completed.</p>

<p>After a week at Jaguára I embarked again. There
was very little to record day by day of the voyage
from Jaguára to Diamantina. The river was ever
changing: sometimes we passed picturesque cliffs;
sometimes we went through gorgeous forests; with
<!--Page 295-->
masses of vegetation rolling and bulging down the
bank; sometimes the currents changed into rapids,
and the bed of the river was studded with islets of
calcareous stone, dangerous during half-flood.</p>

<p>The most dangerous experience was when we shot
the rapids at Cachoeira Grande. People crowded
down to the yellow bank to stare and to frighten us
about them, and the dialogue was somewhat in
this style:--</p>

<p>“Do you know the rapids?” we inquired.</p>

<p>“We know them!”</p>

<p>“Will you pilot us?”</p>

<p>“We will not pilot you!”</p>

<p>“For money?”</p>

<p>“Not for money!”</p>

<p>“And why?”</p>

<p>“Because we are afraid of them!”</p>

<p>This was spoken as the juniors ran along the bank
like ostriches or the natives of Ugogo.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, for the Cachoeira Grande was no
joke, we found, just before we came to the rapids,
on the right bank a small crowd keeping holiday.
The men carried guns in their hands, and wore pistols
and daggers under their open jackets; the women were
in full dress, brilliant as rainbows, with blood-red
flowers in their glossy, crows’-wing hair. Of the
dozen, not one was fairly white. Here we picked
up a pilot or two who came on board. They were
men of few words; they saluted us civilly and
pushed off.</p>

<p><!--Page 296-->
The beginning of the end was the little rapid
of the Saco Grande, or “Big Bend,” where the river
bed, turning sharply from south-east to north-west,
made parallel reaches. To avoid the rock-pier on the
left we floated stern foremost down along the right
bank, and managed the rapid with some difficulty.
Presently we turned to the east-south-west, and faced
the dreaded Cachoeira Grande, which is formed by
another sharp bend in the bed, winding to the north-east.
The obstacles were six very flat projections of dark
stone on the right bank and four on the left, and
cunning is required to spiral down between them.
We began by passing the port of No. 1, then we
made straight for No. 2 to the left; here, by pushing
furiously up stream, the <span class="title">Eliza</span> was forced over to
the right, was swung round by main force of arm,
and was allowed to descend, well in hand, to within
a few feet of No. 4, which rises right in the front.
Finally, leaving this wrecker to starboard, we hit the
usual triangle-head, with plenty of water breaking
off both arms. The descent occupied sixteen minutes.</p>

<p>After many congratulations our friends the pilots
made a show of taking leave to do some important
business, which proved on inquiry to mean “doing
compliments.” As the dangers were not yet over,
I produced a keg of restilo; it was tasted, and
pronounced very hot in the mouth, and the Major&mdash;&#8203;that
is, myself&mdash;&#8203;became so irresistible that they all
swore they would accompany me to the Rio de São
Francisco, or anywhere. The poles were twirled again
<!--Page 297-->
and wielded with a will. We left to port broken
water and an ugly stone, a hogsback; then we crossed
to scrape acquaintance with a sunken mass in front.</p>

<p>The end was the Cachoeira das Gallinhas, to which
we presently came. We gave a wide berth to a rock
well on the right bank and stuck to the left side.
Here was a narrow gate, formed by two rock-piers
projecting from the shores, and in such places
“cordelling” was advisable. The men sprang into
the water with loud cries, and pulled at the hawser
till the current had put us in proper position. They
then pushed off and sprang on board before we could
make much way. The “Rapid of the Hens” occupied
us nine minutes.</p>

<p>A second dram of the “wild stuff” was then given
and our friends the pilots blessed us fervently; they
prayed for us, and unintelligibly invoked for us the
protection of the Virgin and all the saints. They
landed with abundant tripping and stumbling, carrying
with them many dollars and a bottle of the much-prized
restilo. I had every reason to be grateful to
them, for they saved me an immense amount of
trouble; but, shortly afterwards, reports of certain
“little deaths,” in which they had been actively concerned,
showed me that they were not exactly lambs.</p>

<p>After this we proceeded easily down the river to
Bom Successo, from which point I intended to visit
Diamantina City. I had to land here and make my
way to Diamantina on mule-back, not an easy journey,
involving, as it did, a day and a night. Diamantina,
<!--Page 298-->
or the Diamond City, was peculiarly situated, almost
precipitous to the east and south-west, while the
northern part was a continuation of the broken prairie-land.
I stayed here as the guest of Sr. João Ribeiro,
a diamond merchant, and wealthy and hospitable. I
spent at this place three days and thoroughly inspected
it. The impression left upon me was most agreeable;
the men were the frankest, and the women the prettiest
and most amiable, of any it had been my fortune to
meet in Brazil; nothing could exceed their hospitality.
I will not describe my visit to the diamond diggings,
as I have done so fully elsewhere, and this brief sketch
must be mainly devoted to my voyage down the river.
I will only say that I found it most interesting, and,
so far from the diamonds being exhausted, it seemed
to me that they were only at the beginning of a supply
which might be described as inexhaustible.</p>

<p>On the eleventh day I returned to Bom Successo
with great regret, and at 9.30 a.m. on September 7th
I dismissed my trooper and his mules, and pushed
out of the creek down the river towards Coroa do
Gallo. I met with several small troubles, such as
low sandbanks, snags, and stones, but managed to
push through to the Coroa do Gallo, where I spent
the night. The previous day had been burning
hot, but when we set forth the weather had become
temperate, and, indeed, on all this journey there
was nothing much to complain of on account of the
climate. We drifted on day after day through a soft
and balmy atmosphere, disturbed ever and anon by
<!--Page 299-->
gusts of wind and vapours; sometimes distant sheet
lightning flashed from the mists massing around the
horizon, the smoke of the prairie fires rose in columns,
and they might have been mistaken for the fumes of
a steamer by night. Those that were near glowed like
live coals, whilst the more distant gleamed blue.</p>

<p>I landed and stayed a day or two at Guaicuhy, but
there was nothing very important to record. I was
strongly advised to visit the rapids of the Pirapora,
which are said to be, after the Casca d’Anta at the
beginning and the Paulo Affonso at the end, the important
feature upon the Rio de São Francisco. The
word means a “fish leap,” and is applied to places on
more than one Brazilian river. With a flush of joy I
found myself upon this glorious stream of the future,
whose dimensions here measure seven hundred feet.
I had seen nothing to compare with it since my visit
to the African Congo.</p>

<p>Two new men were hired to guide us in the
“tender” canoe, as we wished to shoot the rapids.
We eyed curiously the contrasts of the new stream
with that which we had lately left. Here the water
was of a transparent green; the river seemed to break
even from the stiff clay, which was in places caving
in. After nine hours of hard work we doubled a
wooded projection from the left bank, and sighted
the Cachoeira of the Pirapora. The Pirapora differed
from anything I had yet viewed; it was, in fact, partly
a true fall, divided into two sections, and we trembled
to think what the Paulo Affonso might be. Glad
<!--Page 300-->
to stretch our cramped limbs, we landed on the right
bank, and proceeded to inspect the rapids from above.
The upper rapid, six feet high, seemed more formidable
than the lower of about seven feet. Near the right
bank these form true falls; they are also garnished
by little ladders, miniature cascades rushing furiously
down small, narrow, tortuous, channels, between the
teeth of jagged stone-saws, and tumbling over dwarf
buttresses. Thus the total height between the upper
and the lower “smooths” is thirteen feet. Above
the break the stream narrows to 1,800 feet, whilst
below it broadens to 3,500 feet. During the dry
weather the fair-way, if it may be so called, is a
thin sheet of water near the western bank: no raft,
however, can pass; canoes must be unladen and
towed up. Without a good pilot there is imminent
risk.</p>

<p>A storm was gathering, and as we began the
descent lightning flashed from the east and south, and
from all the horizon, followed by low rumblings of
thunder. Presently our cranky canoe was struck
by the gale, one of the especial dangers of the São
Francisco. The east wind was heard roaring from
afar, and as it came down upon the stream, white
waves rose after a few minutes, subsiding as easily
when the gale had blown itself out. My men preferred
the leeward bank, upon which the blast broke, leaving
the water below comparatively dead, and thus they
escaped the risk of falling trees. The surface of
the central channel being now blocked by the furious
<!--Page 301-->
wind, a backwater during our ascent bore us swiftly
down. It was very dark at 7.30, when we landed
and climbed the steep and slippery bank. The thunder
growled angrily and heavy rain fell, fortunately upon
a tight roof. This was the first wet weather that I
had experienced since July 21st.</p>

<p>The Pirapora had been on the São Francisco my
terminus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad quem</i>, and now it was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a quo</i>, the rest
of the voyage being down stream. When we started
in the morning the weather was still surly from the
effects of last night’s scolding, but the air was transparent
and clear; the books no longer curled with
drought, and a dose from the quinine bottle was
judged advisable. We were evidently at the break
of the rainy season. It was noon before the <span class="title">Eliza</span>
was poled off from the bank of the Guaicuhy, and
turned head downwards into the great stream. We
drifted on from day to day until we arrived at São
Romao, a God-forgotten place, which I explored;
but it was not particularly hospitable, so I returned
at evening and spent the night on the <span class="title">Eliza</span>,
lighted the fire, drew down the awning, and kept
out as much of the drifting rain and cold, shifting
wind as possible. It was not easy to sleep for the
babel of sounds, for the Romanenses were decidedly
ill-behaved and uncivilised, and made night hideous
with their orgies.</p>

<p>We set out again next day, furling the awning,
through the drenching rain. We had a day of
wind and water, and then another of very hot sun,
<!--Page 302-->
and so we went on to Januaria, where I met with
frank and ready hospitality. After staying here
a night, we took the water again, and proceeded
through a small hurricane to Carunhanha, where
also I was well received, but had to sleep on board
the raft&mdash;&#8203;another night of devilry. Cold wind from
the north rushed through the hot air, precipitating
a deluge in embryo; then the gale chopped round
to the south, and produced another, and fiercer,
down-pour. A treacherous lull, and all began again,
the wind howling and screaming from the east. The
thunder roared and the lightning flashed in all
directions; the stream rose in wavelets, which washed
over the <span class="title">Eliza</span>, and shook her by the bumping of
the “tender” canoe. We did not get much sleep
that night.</p>

<p>I will not further describe my voyage day after
day in the <span class="title">Eliza</span>. Suffice it to say, at Varzéa
Redonda, a wretched village just before we came
to the Paulo Affonso, I dismantled the <span class="title">Eliza</span> and
paid off the crew. I was asked to stay on land,
but, as I wished to see everything settled, I slept
on board, and regretted my resolution. The night
was furious, and the wind raised waves that nearly
beat the old raft to pieces. My men, having reached
the end of their work, had the usual boatman’s spree&mdash;&#8203;hard
drinking, extensive boasting, trials of strength,
and quarrelling, intermixed with singing, shouting,
extemporising verses, and ending in the snores and
snorts of Bacchic sleep. I found them very troublesome;
<!--Page 303-->
but the next morning they shed tears of
contrition. I saw them disappear without regret; the
only face, indeed, that I was sorry to part from was
that of the good old pilot.</p>

<p>The next step was to procure animals and men to
take me to the Great Rapids. I had great difficulty
in getting these, and when the party was made up
it consisted of the worst men, the worst mules, and
the worst equipments I had ever seen in Brazil. In
two days and two nights I arrived at Paulo Affonso,
the King of the Rapids.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first approach to it. In
the distance we heard a deep, hollow sound, soft
withal, like the rumbling of a distant storm, but
it seemed to come from below the earth, as if we trod
upon it. After another mile the ground appeared
to tremble at the eternal thunder. A little later
we came upon the rapids. Paulo Affonso has well
been called the Niagara of Brazil.</p>

<p>The quebrada, or gorge, is here two hundred
and sixty feet deep; in the narrowest part it is choked
to a minimum breadth of fifty-one feet. It is filled
with what seems not water but froth and milk, a
dashing and dazzling, a whirling and churning
surfaceless mass, which gives a wondrous study of
fluid in motion. Here the luminous whiteness of
the chaotic foam-crests, hurled in billows and breakers
against the blackness of the rock, is burst into flakes
and spray that leap half-way up the immuring trough.
Then the steam boils over and canopies the tremendous
<!--Page 304-->
scene. In the stilly air of dull, warm grey, the
mists surge up, deepening still more the dizzy fall
that yawns under our feet.</p>

<p>The general effect of the picture, and the same may
be said of all great cataracts, is the realised idea of
power&mdash;&#8203;of power tremendous, inexorable, irresistible.
The eye is spell-bound by the contrast of this impetuous
motion, this wrathful, maddened haste to escape, with
the frail stedfastness of the bits of rainbow, hovering
above, with the “Table Rock,” so solid to the tread,
and with the placid, settled stillness of the plain and
hillocks, whose eternal homes seem to be here. Magic,
I may observe, is in the atmosphere of Paulo Affonso;
it is the natural expression of the glory and the majesty,
the splendour and the glamour of the scene, which
Greece would have peopled with shapes of beauty, and
which in Germany would be haunted by choirs of flying
sylphs and dancing Undines.</p>

<p>I sat over the cataract until convinced it was not
possible to become one with the waters; what at first
seemed grand and sublime had at last a feeling of awe,
too intense to be in any way enjoyable. The rest of
the day I spent in camp, where the minor troubles of
life soon asserted their power. The sand raised by
the strong and steady trade-wind was troublesome, and
the surface seething in the sun produced a constant
drought. We were now at the head of the funnel, the
vast ventilator which guides the gale to the Rio
de São Francisco. At night the sky showed a fast-drifting
scud, and an angry blast dispersed the gathering
<!--Page 305-->
clouds of blood-thirsty mosquitos. Our lullaby was
the music of Paulo Affonso.</p>

<p>The next day I visited the falls again and explored
them thoroughly, going down from the heights above
to the base beneath, from which the finest view of the
falls was to be obtained. It was a grand climax to my
voyage down the São Francisco.</p>

<p>My task was done; I won its reward, and my
strength passed from me. Two days of tedious
mountain riding led to the Porto das Piranhas, and
from here I descended the lower Rio de São Francisco
more leisurely, and, when that was done, I finally returned
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> Rio de Janeiro to Santos (São Paulo), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i>
the Wapping of the Far West, and took up my
consular duties once again.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent dropcap">I &thinsp;AM “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partant pour la Syrie</i>,” and though it is comparatively
near, we find the journey long. We
take steamer to Alexandria, and there await the first
vessel going northwards. We embark in a foreign
steamer, much preferring the Russian, and after passing,
perhaps without sighting, the base of the Nile Delta
and the northern terminus of the Suez Canal, we run
rapidly up the coast of the Holy Land. We are near
enough to see certain of its features, and to feel a
throbbing of the heart. Here is Ascalon, the “Bride
of Syria,” still redolent of the days of the lion-hearted
king and of the right royal Saláh-el-Din. There is
Jaffa, the Joppa ever full of the memories of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter.
We touch there, but we may not land unless the sea
is of the calmest. Now we steam along the site of
Cæsarea, the busy city of Herod Agrippa, converted
into the most silent waste of ruins that it has ever been
our fate to look upon. There we cast anchor for a few
days, at the second station, Hazfa, opposite <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jean
d’Acre, that “Key of Palestine” from the days of the
Crusaders to the times of Bonaparte, Sir Sydney Smith,
and Sir Charles Napier. From this point we swerve
<!--Page 310-->
rapidly past the brown headland of Carmel, type of
excellent beauty to the Hebrew poet, past the white
Scala Tyrivrum, whose <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promontorium album</i> might be a
fragment of the white cliffs of Albion, past the bright
little town of Tyre, a phœnix rising a third time from
its ashes, and past Sidon and Lebanon, memorial names
engraved upon our childish hearts too deeply for time
or change ever to erase them from the memory of the
man. So memorial, indeed, are all these regions that
the traveller must keep watch and ward upon himself,
under penalty of suffering from what I may call “Holy
Land on the brain.” The essence of it consists in
seeing all things, not as they are, but as they ought to
be; for instance, “hanging gardens” at Damascus,
“Roman bridges” in Saracenic arches, and “beautiful
blush marble” in limestone stained with oxide. It
wrings the hearts of its friends when sighting the Plain
of Esdraelon, and in gazing upon a certain mound it
exclaims:</p>

<p class="center small">What hill is like to Tabor’s hill in beauty and in grace?</p>

<p class="unindent">This clairvoyance, or idealism, which makes men
babble of green fields where only dust meets the
eye of sense is by no means an obscure disorder
of the brain; on the contrary, it is rather aggressive
and violent, whilst writers of guides and handbooks
appear abnormally exposed to it. Hence those who
prepare for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land must
temper information and description with many a
grain of salt, or they will undergo no little disappointment.
Ideal pleasures ever excel those of reality;
<!--Page 311-->
but in this case there is an extra and inordinate supply
of ideality.</p>

<p>We disembark at the hopeless, wind-lashed roadstead
of Beyrut, within the limits of the Land of Promise,
but never yet included in the Land of Possession.
The trim little harbour-town, seated upon its sloping
amphitheatre, converted into “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Colossia Julia Augusta
Felix Berytus</i>” must have been a local Pompeii in
the fourth and fifth centuries, and its feminine bust
was found associated with the medallions of Alexandria
and Halicarnassus. During those ages the Roman
and Egyptian galleys jostled one another in the inner
port, which now looks like a dock; their palaces
and villas covered the slopes with pillars and
colonnades; paradises and gardens contrasted with
proud fanes rising upon well-wooded and well-watered
peaks around&mdash;&#8203;fanes dedicated to gods and goddesses
now remembered only by the classical dictionaries.
In those days, students of philosophy and theology,
of law and language, flocked to Berytus from the
most distant lands. But the terrible earthquake of
<span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 551, which laid waste a pleasant site, seems to
have been the turning-point of its destinies; the
roadstead apparently became shallow, and, despite
a noted miracle in the eighth century, Beyrut saw
her glory depart for many a generation. At last,
in the beginning of the nineteenth century, it had
sunk to its lowest, and the petty port, placed under
the unimportant Pashalate of Sidon, numbered barely
five hundred souls.</p>

<p><!--Page 312-->
Sir Charles Napier, the sailor, changed all that.
In the autumn of 1840 he made Beyrut his headquarters,
whence he and his gallant crews ranged
the hill country around and blockaded the ports,
till the career of Ibrahim Pasha was unfortunately
cut short. Thereupon the hat began at once to take
precedence of the turban, even of the green turban.
The headquarters of the Pashalate were transferred
from Sidon to Beyrut; European merchants established
country houses; missionaries opened schools for both
sexes; the different consular corps contended for
the construction of roads and the abatement of
nuisances; whilst the port was regularly visited by
four lines of steamers. Briefly, Beyrut became the
only Europeanised place in Syria, and she will probably
remain so for many years.</p>

<p>The old part of the city still retains some marks
of Orientalism; the old part, with its alleys, wynds,
and closes, its wretched lanes, its narrow and slippery
thoroughfares, resembling unroofed sewers, is peculiarly
sombre and Syrian, full of dead men’s bones and
all uncleanliness. Nothing can be meaner than the
Customs House, where millions of piastres annually
change hands. Of the stately buildings which once
adorned it no traces remain but three granite
monolithic columns, still towering above modern
misery. But the new town which surrounds the
ancient archery is Levantine&mdash;&#8203;that is to say, almost
Italian; the points of difference being a scatter of
minarets and a sprinkling of tropical vegetation, which
<!--Page 313-->
tells you that you are somewhat nearer the sun.
There are houses and hospitals large enough each
to lodge its battalions; piano and bugle sounds catch
the ear; the carriage is taking the place of the horse
and the mule&mdash;&#8203;here, as in South America, a sure
sign of civilisation; and Orientalism is essentially
at a discount. You must not think of Beyrut as
an Eastern city.</p>

<p>Life is easy and death is easier in these sub-tropical
regions. Men do little during six days, and carefully
rest on the seventh. For eight months they saunter
through the tepid air of the Mediterranean seaboard;
the other four are spent upon “the mountain”
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> Lebanon), whose pure, light air is a tonic.
The little world of Beyrut rises rather late, and its
business hours are but before the noontide breakfast,
for here, as amongst the classics, the meals are two
per diem. They would be called by our grandfathers
dinner and supper; we say breakfast and dinner.
Then a little more work precedes a drive or a ride:
the stroll is not unknown, the constitutional is.
The evenings are spent either in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i> or in visits,
where whist at times puts in an appearance, and
a profound stillness, like that of Lime Street, City,
begins to reign about 10 p.m. The theatre has
not been imported, although an enterprising Syrian
Christian&mdash;&#8203;Moslems cannot originate such things&mdash;&#8203;has,
after a visit to Italy, written several comedies
in the classical style, unfortunately adopting the
French rhymed couplet. The tea party, the little
<!--Page 314-->
music, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée dansante</i>, flourish in what
the Beyrutines are pleased to call the “Paris of
Syria.” The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeunesse dorée</i>, in patent leather boots,
“boiled shirts,” fold collars, white ties, and lemon-coloured
gloves, loves to don the sables which the
English gentleman affects. When he goes forth
to make merry, he enters gloves in hand; he prefers
round dances to square, and he imitates Europe
very literally. But as the Romans kept up the
time-honoured and homely eggs as the end of their
richest banquets, so the “golden youth” of Beyrut
prefers the ugly and unpleasant fez or tarbush.
For the rest, young Syria’s ambition is to marry
a European wife, and he does not always get the
best of <em>that</em> bargain.</p>

<p>In these lands Society still preserves the fragmentary
nature which belonged to the ancient world. Beyrut,
the port, at the time whereof I write, is distant a
single day’s ride from Damascus, the capital of Syria,
yet there is no trace of sympathy between the two,
and the inland say of the seaboard city:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Its sun cracks [wood or teak],</div>
<div class="i0">And its water is salt,</div>
<div class="i0">And its falls are cloud de Paris [dirty of lead].</div>
</div></div>

<p class="unindent">Again Damascus jeers:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Perish Beyrut, for the reason that her heat resembles Sakar [the eighth hell].</div>
<div class="i0">No flowing of milk is found in her, though her sons are [stupid as] cows.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="unindent">Whereto Beyrut retorts:</p>

<!--Page 315-->
<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">At Aleppo man is a dandy and vain,</div>
<div class="i0">At Shan [Damascus] he is niggard and mean,</div>
<div class="i0">And the Nizri [Egyptian] is simply a rascal.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="unindent">Whilst “the lying of Damascus” is an illustration in
the mouth of every Beyrutine. We have a rhyme
of the kind touching one&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Sir Vicary Gibbs,</div>
<div class="i0">The inventor of fibs.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="unindent">But Damascus says of herself, when describing a
man who has became civilised: “He hath been
Damascus’d.” These sharp sayings, indeed, are
not confined to the capital and the port. As of old
upon the Sorrentine Plains, to speak of no other
place, every town had a nickname, a rhyme, or a
tale attached to it, which “kinder ryled up” the
inhabitants, so it is the case throughout modern
Syria. Thus of Jerusalem men say, as of Meccah:</p>

<p class="center small">Her soil is sacred, her sons are soiled.</p>

<p class="unindent">Of Tiberias, a town built of basalt:</p>

<p class="center small">Her stones are black, and her people are Jews.</p>

<p class="unindent">Of the Naw’arinah, or people of the Auranitis (the
great Hauran Valley), we are told that:</p>

<p class="center small">They thrice bewildered the Apostle of Allah [Mohammed].</p>

<p class="unindent">The modern inhabitants of ancient Heliopolis, where
Burckhardt found the handsomest woman in Syria,
is dubbed:</p>

<p class="center small">A Ba’albak bear.</p>

<p>The Halbem village near Damascus is a standing
<!--Page 316-->
joke with the witty citizens on account of the huge
woollen turbans, the loud voice, and the peculiar
dispositions of the people. They make “kass,” or
lamp-wicks, for Damascus, and it is said that on
one occasion, when their shaykh was imprisoned,
they threatened, by withholding the supply, to keep
the city in total darkness. Also, as a bride was being
led home, mounted on an ass, when the doorway
was found too low, the popular voice said that her
head should be cut off, till some local wise man of
Gotham suggested that she might dismount.</p>

<p>Beyrut in my day was connected with Damascus
by the only carriageable road in the Holy Land,
which was supposed to boast of two others, the Jaffa-Jerusalem
and the Alexandretto-Aleppo. These two,
however, are utterly unfit for wheels, the reason being
that they were laid out by native engineers and
administered by the Turks, a nation that has succeeded
in nothing but destruction. The distance is forty-seven
and a half geographical miles, prolonged to sixty
by the old road and to seventy-two by the new one.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>We could travel to Damascus by night coach or
<!--Page 317-->
by day diligence, preferring the latter, which enables
us to see the land. At 4 a.m. we leave the harbour-town,
and we shall reach our destination at 6 p.m.
The section between the Mediterranean and Damascus,
the sea and the Euphrates Desert, is an epitome of
Syria, which has been described to be an epitome
of the whole world; a volume might be easily written
upon what is seen during that day’s journey. After
a couple of miles through suburbs, cemeteries, and
scattered villas, orchards of mulberry and olive,
lanes hedged with prickly pear and dense clumps
of young stone-pines, the road begins to ascend
the westward, or maritime, slope of the Lebanon.
It works gradually towards the left bank of the great
gorge called Wady Hammánah, in one of whose
hamlets Lamartine lived and wrote. After some
twelve miles from the Beyrut Plain, we reach the
watershed of the Jurd, or Highlands of the Lebanon.
Here we are about 5,500 feet above sea-level, and
feel immensely relieved, in fine weather at least,
from the damp heat of the malarious seaboard, which
robs the stranger of appetite and rest. The view,
too, is charming: a glimpse of sparkling sea, a well-wooded
sandstone region, and a long perspective
of blue and purple chain and peak, cut and torn
by valley, gorge, and ravine, scarring both flanks
of the prism. Looking eastward, we sight for the
first time that peculiar basaltic bed which gives
rise to the Jordan, the Orontes, and the Litani (a
river of Tyre). It appears to be a volcanic depression
<!--Page 318-->
sunk in the once single range of secondary limestone,
and splitting it into two parallel chains, the Libanus
and the Anti-Libanus. Viewed from above it is
a Spanish viga, a plain of wondrous wealth and
fertility, whilst the surface appears smooth as a lake.
It is, however, in places dangerously swampy, and
though raised some 2,500 to 3,000 feet above sea-level,
it is an unwholesome and aguish site, alternately
very hot and very cold, curiously damp and distressingly
dry. And the same may be said of Damascus,
which has to the east the scorching desert, and to
the west mountains, mostly snowy: it is no wonder
that the old author called it the “windy.” But the
climate of Damascus is complicated by perhaps the
worst and hardest water in Syria, by the exceeding
uncleanliness of the place, and by the habits of the
population. To say that man can exist there at all
speaks volumes in his favour.</p>

<p>Rapidly we run down the eastern, or landward,
counterslope of the Lebanon, remembering the anti-Jacobin
couplet:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">And down thy slopes romantic Ashdown glides</div>
<div class="i0">The Derby dilly carrying six insides.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="unindent">Before its lowest folds we find the fifth station,
Shtóra; here, as it is now 10 a.m., we breakfast. We
at once realise what will be the bill of fare in the
interior. Bread? perhaps. Potatoes? possibly. Beef
or veal? impossible. Pig? ridiculous. Little, in fact,
but lean kid and lamb, mutton, and fowls whose breast-bones
pierce their skins. Wine? yes&mdash;&#8203;dear and bad.
<!--Page 319-->
Beer or porter, seltzer or soda? decidedly no. In the
winter game is to be had, woodcock and wild duck,
hares and gazelles; but the diet is held to be heating
and bilious. Vegetables, however, are plentiful, and,
during the season, fruit is abundant, with the usual
drawback in half-civilised lands: wall fruit is all but
unknown, and, with the exception of the excellent
grapes and the unwholesome apricots, each kind lasts
only a few days.</p>

<p>After breakfast we spin by a straight road&mdash;&#8203;such as
old Normandy knew and modern Canada still knows&mdash;&#8203;the
breadth of the valley. It is laid out in little fields,
copiously irrigated. The little villages which stud the
plain are, like those of Egypt, not of Syria, built on
mounds, and black with clay plastered over the wicker-work.
Every mile or so has some classical ruin: on
our right a Báal temple; to our left Chalcis ad Belum;
whilst six hours of slow riding northwards, or up the
valley, place you at immortal Báalbak, which the Greeks
still call Heliopolis.</p>

<p>A rising plane and a bend to the right land us at
the first of the Anti-Libanus. Instead of ascending
and descending this range, as we did with the Lebanon
prism, we thread a ravine called by the Druzes the
Valley of Silk, from their favourite article of plunder.
An easy up-slope leads to Sahlat Judaydah, the dwarf
plateau about 3,600 feet high, where the watershed
changes from west to east; farther on to the wild
gorge Wady el Karn (“of the Thorn”), so called from
its rich ribbings and the wreathing and winding of the
<!--Page 320-->
bed. We find a stiff climb or a long zigzag at the
Akabat el Tin (the Steep of Lime).</p>

<p>The descent of the steep ends with the Daurat el
Billau (Zigzag of the Camel Thorn), and thence we
fall into the Sahrat el Dimas, so called from a village
which may have borrowed a name from the penitent
thief. This Sahara has been described with prodigious
exaggeration in order to set off by contrast the charms
of the so-termed “sublime Gorge of Abana,” to which
it leads. Measuring some ten kilometres, it is undoubtedly
a rough bit of ground, dry as dust in the
summer, and in winter swept by raving winds and
piled with sleet and snow. At its eastern end the
Sahara at once dips into a deep, lateral gorge, which
feeds, after rains, the Barada Valley, and here we
remark that curious contrast of intense fertility
with utter, hopeless barrenness which characterises
inner Spain. Life is in that thick line of the darkest
and densest evergreen, which, smiling under the fierce
and fiery sun-glare, threads the side of the valley, in
the wholesome perfume of the wild plants, and in the
gush and murmur of waters making endless music.
Death is represented by the dull grey formation standing
up in tombstones, by the sterile yellow lime-rock,
and by the chalk, blinding white; and the proportion
of good to bad is as one to twenty. This verdure is,
the Arabs say, a cooling to the eye of the beholder;
it is like the aspect of the celadon-coloured sea that
beats upon the torrid West African shores. With the
author of that charming book “Eothen,” “you float
<!--Page 321-->
along (for the delight is as the delight of bathing)
through green, wavy fields and down into the cool
verdure of groves and gardens, and you quench hot
eyes in shade as though in deep, rushing waters.”</p>

<p>The beginning of the end is at the tenth and last
station, El Hamah, meaning the Head of the Valley,
and we halt here for a cup of coffee. The next place
of note is Dummar; here we cross the Barada torrent.
This place is, despite its low site and hot and cold air,
a favourite for villas; and certain wealthy Damascus
usurers have here built large piles, as remarkable for
the barbarity of their outer frescoes as for the tawdry
decoration of the interior. The witty Damasceines
call them “traps,” because they are periodically let
to high officials for other considerations than hire.
And now, with its slate-coloured stream, garnished with
weirs on our right, the valley becomes broader and
more important; the upper cliff’s are tunnelled into
cut caves, Troglodyte dwellings and sepulchres of the
ancients; seven veins at high levels and at low levels
branch off from the main artery; and, after passing a
natural gateway formed by two shield-like masses of
rock, we suspect that Damascus is before us.</p>

<p>The first sight of Damascus was once famous in
travel. But then men rode on horseback, and
turned, a little beyond Damascus, sharply to the left
of the present line. They took what was evidently
the old Roman road, and which is still, on account
of its being a short cut, affected by muleteers. Now
it is nothing but an ugly climb up sheet-rock and
<!--Page 322-->
rolling stones, with bars and holes dug by the armed
hoof of many a generation. They then passed
through El Zaarub (the Spout); this is the old way,
sunk some ten feet deep in the rock till it resembles
an uncovered tunnel, and polished like glass by
the traffic and transit of ages. At its mouth you
suddenly turn a corner and see Damascus lying in
panorama, a few hundred feet below you. “A flint
set in emeralds” is the Damascus citizen’s description
of what El Islam calls, and miscalls, the “smile of
the Prophet” (Mohammed). Like Stambul, it is
beautiful from afar, as it is foul and sore within,
morally and physically. The eye at once distinguishes
a long head, the northern suburb “El Salituzzah”;
a central nucleus, crescent-shaped and fronting the
bed of the Barada; and a long tail, or southern
suburb, “El Maydan.” These three centres of whitewashed
dwellings and skyline, fretted with dome and
minaret, are surrounded and backed by a mass of
evergreen orchard, whose outlines are sharply defined
by irrigation, whilst beyond the scatter of outlying
villages, glare the sunburnt yellow and the parched
rich brown of the desert, whose light blue hillocks
define the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>The prosaic approach by the French road shows
little beyond ruins and graveyards: Damascus outside
is a mass of graveyards, the “Great” and
“Little Camps” of Constantinople, only without
their cypresses; whilst within it is all graveyards
and ruins, mixed with crowded and steaming bazaars.
<!--Page 323-->
This world of graves reminds one of Job’s forlorn man
dwelling “in desolate cities, and in houses which no
man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.”
The Barada in olden times had its stone embankment;
the walls are now in ruins. On our right is a ruined
bridge once leading to a large coffee-house, both also
in ruins. As we advance we pass other ruins. But
though it was prophesied that Damascus should be
a “ruinous heap,” her position forbids annihilation.
The second of Biblical cities, she has been destroyed
again and again; her houses have been levelled with
the ground, and the Tartar has played hockey with the
hearts of her sons. Still she sits upon the eastern
folds of the Anti-Libanus and on her gold-rolling river,
boldly overlooking the desert at her base. Damascus,
not Rome, deserves, if any does, to be entitled the
Eternal City.</p>

<p>I passed twenty-three months (October 1st, 1869,
to August 20th, 1871), on and off, at this most
picturesque and unpleasant of residences. It was
then in the transitional state, neither of Asia nor of
Europe. To one who had long lived in the outer
East, a return to such an ambiguous state of things
was utterly disenchanting. Hassan, digging or delving
in long beard and long clothes, looks more like an
overgrown baby than the romantic being which your
fancies paint him. Fatima, with a coloured kerchief
(not a nose-bag) over her face, possibly spotted for
greater hideousness, with Marseilles gloves and French
bottines of yellow satin, trimmed with fringe and
<!--Page 324-->
bugles, protruding from the white calico which might
be her winding-sheet, is an absurdity: she reminded
me of sundry “kings” on the West African shore,
whose toilet consists of a bright bandanna and a
chimney-pot hat, of the largest dimensions, coloured
the liveliest sky-blue.</p>

<p>The first steps to be taken at Damascus were to
pay and receive visits, to find a house, to hire
servants, to buy horses, and, in fact, to settle ourselves.
It proved no easy matter. Certain persons
had amused themselves with spreading a report that
my pilgrimage to Meccah had aroused Moslem
fanaticism, and perhaps might cost me my life. They,
as well as I, knew far better, so I was not surprised
at the kind and even friendly reception given to me
by Emir Abdel Kadir, of Algerine fame, and by the
Dean of the great Cathedral el Amahi, the late Shaykh
Abdahah el Halati. And I remember with satisfaction
that, to the hour of my quitting Damascus, the
Moslems never showed for me any but the most
cordial feeling.</p>

<p>Other British consuls had been of a stay-at-home
disposition, seeing nothing beyond the length of
their noses. I was of a roving one, and determined
to see all I could, and penetrate to the inner heart
of Syria. To be shut up in Damascus was to be in
prison; the breath of the desert was liberty. I soon
wandered afield. One of my earliest excursions was
to Palmyra. Until the spring of 1870 a traveller
visiting Syria for the express purpose, perhaps, of
<!--Page 325-->
seeing Palmyra, “Tadmor in the Wilderness,” after
being kept waiting for months at Damascus, had
to return disappointed. Only the rich could afford
the large Bedouin escort, for which even six thousand
francs and more have been demanded. Add to this
the difficulties, hardships, and dangers of the journey,
the heat of the arid desert, want of water, chances
of attack, the long forced marches by night and hiding
by day, ending with a shabby halt of forty-eight hours
at a place for which so many sacrifices had been
made, and where a fortnight is the minimum required.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the last century the Porte
has had in view a military occupation of the caravan
route between Damascus and the Euphrates. “The
Turk will catch up your best hare on the back of
a lame donkey,” say the Arabs, little thinking what
high praise they award to the conquering race. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon militaire</i> was to extend from Damascus,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> Jayrud, Karyatayn, Palmyra, and Sukhnah, to
Daye on the great rim. The wells were to be
commanded by block houses, the roads to be cleared
by movable columns, and thus the plundering Bedouin,
who refuse all allegiance to the Sultan, would be
kept, perforce, in the dan, or desert, between the
easternmost offsets of the Anti-Libanus and the
pitch uplands of Nijd. This project was apparently
rescued from the fate of good intentions by Osman
Bey, a Hungarian officer who had served the Porte
since 1848. He moved from Hamah with a body
of some 1,600 men&mdash;&#8203;enough to cut his way through
<!--Page 326-->
half the vermin in Araby the Unblest. Presently,
after occupying Palmyra, building barracks, and
restoring the old Druze Castle, he proceeded eastward
to Sukhnah, whence he could communicate with
the force expected to march westward from Baghdad.
The welcome intelligence was hailed with joy: Palmyra,
so long excluded from the Oriental tour, lay open
to the European traveller; half a step had been
taken towards a Euphrates Valley Railway; at
Damascus men congratulated themselves upon the
new line of frontier, which was naturally expected
to strengthen and to extend the limits of Syria; and
the merchant rejoiced to learn that his caravan would
be no longer liable to wholesale plunder.</p>

<p>A fair vision, doomed soon to fade! After six
months or so of occupation, Osman Bey, whose
men were half starving, became tired of Palmyra, and
was recalled to Damascus. The garrison was reduced
to two hundred men under a captain, whose only
friend was the raki bottle, and the last I saw of
the garrison was his orderly riding into Hauran,
with the huge, empty demijohns dangling at his saddle-bow.
The Bedouin waxed brave, and, in the spring
of 1871, I was obliged to send travellers to Palmyra
by a long circuit, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> the north and the north-west.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><!--Page 327-->
A certain official business compelled me to visit
Karyatayn, which is within jurisdiction of Damascus,
and my wife resolved to accompany me. In this
little enterprise I was warmly seconded by the Vicomte
de Perrochel, a French traveller and author, who had
twice visited Damascus in the hope of reaching
Tadmor, and by M. Ionine, my Russian colleague.
The Governor-General, the Field Marshal commanding
the army of Syria, and other high officials, lent
us their best aid. We engaged a pair of dragomen,
six servants, a cook, and eight muleteers; twelve
mules and eight baggage-asses to carry tents and
canteen, baggage and provisions; and we rode our
own horses, being wrongly persuaded not to take
donkeys&mdash;&#8203;on long marches they would have been
a pleasant change. We were peculiarly unfortunate
in the choice of head dragoman, a certain Anton
Wardi, who had Italianised his name to Riza.
Originally a donkey-boy at Beyrut, he made, by
“skinning” sundry travellers, some 80,000 francs
in ten years. He was utterly spoiled by his
French friends, M. de Sauley and M. de Perrochel;
he had also dragomaned the then Princess Amadeo,
who, in return for his mean conduct, had promised
him, and afterwards sent him, greatly to the
disgust of every Italian gentleman, the Order of
the Rose. This “native gentleman,” the type of
the ignoble <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit bourgeois</i> of Syria, had been trusted
without any contract having been made. He charged
us a hundred francs per diem, and the others each fifty
<!--Page 328-->
francs and forty francs. When the bill was produced
for settlement, it proved to be a long list of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des extras</i>:
everything was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un extra</i>; two bottles of cognac,
reported broken, appeared as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des extras</i>; even the
water-camels were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des extras</i>. The fact was, he had
allowed, when galloping about the country, some
francs to fall from his pocket, and he resolved that
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les extras</i> should replace them.</p>

<p>We altogether regretted the assistance of Mohammed,
Shaykh of the Mezrab tribe, who had systematically
fleeced travellers for a score of years. He demanded
two napoleons a head for his wretched camels,
sending a score when only one was wanted; like
all other chiefs, he would not guarantee his protégés,
either in purse or person, against enemies, but only
against his own friends; he allowed them but two
days at Palmyra; he made them march twenty,
instead of fifteen, hours between Karyatayn and their
destination; he concealed the fact that there are wells
the whole way, in order to make them hire camels
and buy water-skins; and, besides harassing them
with night marches, he organised sham attacks, in
order to make them duly appreciate his protection.
I rejoice to say that Mohammed’s occupation has since
gone; his miserable tribe was three times plundered
within eighteen months, and, instead of fighting, he
fell back upon the desert. May thus end all who
oppose their petty interests to the general good&mdash;&#8203;all
that would shut roads instead of opening them! With
a view of keeping up his title to escort travellers,
<!--Page 329-->
he sent with us a clansman upon a well-bred mare
and armed with the honourable spear. But M. de
Perrochel hired the mare; the crestfallen man was
put upon a baggage-mare, and the poor spear was
carried by a lame donkey.</p>

<p>Armed to the teeth, we set out in a chorus of
groans and with general prognostications of evil.
Ours was the first party since M. Dubois d’Angus
was dangerously wounded, stripped, and turned out
to die of hunger, thirst, and cold, because he could
not salary the inevitable Bedouin. It would, doubtless,
have been the interest of many and the delight of
more to see us return in the scantiest of costumes;
consequently a false report generally flew abroad that
we had been pursued and plundered by the Bedouin.</p>

<p>The first night was passed under canvas near a
ruined khan in the fifth valley plain east of the Syrian
metropolis. The weather became unusually cold the
next morning when we left the foggy lowland and
turned to the north-east in order to cross the ridgy
line of hills, which, offsetting from the Anti-Libanus,
runs from Damascus toward the desert, and afterwards
sweeps round to Palmyra. The line of travel was
a break in the ridge. Then, gently descending, we
fell into a northern depression, a section of that
extensive valley in the Anti-Libanus, which, under
a variety of names, runs nearly straight north-east
(more exactly, 60°), to Palmyra. Nothing can be
simpler than the geography of the country. The
traveller cannot lose his way in the Palmyra Valley
<!--Page 330-->
without crossing the high and rugged mountains
which hem it in on both sides, and, if he is attacked
by raiders, he can easily take refuge, and laugh at
the Arab goatees. During the time of our journey
the miserable little robber clans Shitai and Ghiyas
had completely closed the country five hours’ riding
to the east of Damascus, whilst the Sorbai and the
Anergah bandits were making the Merj a battlefield
and were threatening to burn down the peaceful
villages. Even as we crossed the pass we were
saddened by the report that a troop of Bedouin had
the day before murdered a wretched peasant within
easy sight of Damascus. This state of things was a
national scandal to the Porte, which, of course, was
never allowed to know the truth.</p>

<p>We resolved to advance slowly, to examine every
object, and to follow the most indirect paths. Hence
our march to Palmyra occupied eight days; we returned,
however, in four with horses that called loudly
for a week’s rest. The regular stations are as follows:&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<table summary="">

</table>

<p>On the second day we dismissed our escort, one
officer and two privates of irregular cavalry, who were
worse than useless, and we slept at the house of Daas
Agha, hereditary Chief of Jayrud. A noted sabre, and
able to bring one hundred and fifty lances into the field,
<!--Page 331-->
he was systematically neglected by the authorities,
because supposed to be friendly with foreigners.
Shortly after my departure he barbarously tortured
two wretched Arabs, throwing them into a pit full of
fire, and practising upon them with his revolver.
Thereupon he was at once taken into prime favour,
and received a command.</p>

<p>Daas Agha escorted us from Jayrud with ten of his
kinsmen mounted upon their best mares. In the upland
valley we suffered severely from cold, and the
sleety sou’wester which cut our faces on the return
was a caution.</p>

<p>At Karyatayn, which we reached on the fifth day,
Osman Bey, who was waiting for rations, money,
transport, in fact, everything, offered us the most
friendly welcome, and I gave official protection to
Shaykh Faris, in connection with the English post at
Baghdad. The former detached with us eighty bayonets
of regulars and twenty-five sabres of Irregulars, commanded
by two officers. This body presently put to
flight anything in the way of Bedouin; a war party
of two thousand men would not have attacked us; and
I really believe that a band of thirty Englishmen armed
with carbines and revolvers could sweep clean the
Desert of the Euphrates from end to end.</p>

<p>At Karyatayn we hired seventeen camels to carry
water. This would have been a complete waste of
money had we gone, like other travellers, by the Darb
el Sultain, or High Way. Some three hours’ ride to
the right, or south, of the road amongst the hills
<!--Page 332-->
bounding the Palmyra Valley is a fine cistern (Ibex
Fountain), where water is never wanting. There is,
however, a still more direct road <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> the remains of an
aqueduct and a river in the desert. This short cut
from Karyatayn to Palmyra may be covered in twenty-four
hours of camel walking, fifteen of horse walking,
and twelve by dromedary or hard gallop. Travellers
would start at 6.30 or 7 a.m., and encamp after being
out from twelve to thirteen hours; but this includes
breakfast and sundry halts, sometimes to inspect
figures, real or imaginary, in the distance, at other
times to indulge in a “spurt” after a gazelle or a
wild boar.</p>

<p>We chose, however, the little-known Baghdad, or
eastern, road. The next day we rested at a large
deserted khan, and on the eighth we made our
entrance into Palmyra, where we were hospitably
received by Shaykh Faris. Our muleteers, for the
convenience of their cattle, pitched their tents close to,
and east of, the so-called Grand Colonnade, a malarious
and unwholesome site. They should have encamped
amongst the trees at a threshing-floor near three palms.
Travellers may be strongly advised not to lodge in the
native village, whose mud huts, like wasps’ nests, are
all huddled within the ancient Temple of the Sun, or
they may suffer from fever or ophthalmia. The water
of Tadmor is sulphurous, like Harrogate, the climate
is unhealthy, and the people are ragged and sickly.
May there, as in most parts of the northern hemisphere,
is the best travelling-season, and in any but a
<!--Page 333-->
phenomenal year the traveller need not fear to encounter,
as we did, ice and snow, siroccos and furious
sou’westers.</p>

<p>If asked whether Palmyra is worth all this trouble,
I should reply “No” and “Yes.” No, if you merely
go there, stay two days, and return, especially after
sighting noble Báalbak. Certainly not for the Grand
Colonnade of weather-beaten limestone, by a stretch of
courtesy called marble, which, rain-washed and earthquake-shaken,
looks like a system of galleries. Not
for the Temple of the Sun, the building of a Roman
emperor, a second-rate affair, an architectural evidence
of Rome’s declining days. Yes, if you would study
the site and the environs, which are interesting and
only partially explored, make excavations, and collect
coins and relics, which may be bought for a song.</p>

<p>The site of Palmyra is very interesting; she stands
between the mountains and the sea; like Damascus,
she sits upon the eastern slope of the Anti-Libanus,
facing the wilderness, but unhappily she has a dry
torrent bed, the Wady el Sayl, instead of a rushing
Barada. She is built upon the shore cape, where the
sandy sea breaks upon its nearest headlands. This
sea is the mysterious Wilderness of the Euphrates,
whose ships are camels, whose yachts are high-bred
mares, and whose cock-boats are mules and asses.
She is on the very threshold of the mountains, which
the wild cavalry cannot scour, as they do the level
plain. And her position is such that we have not
heard the last of the Tadmor, or, as the Arabs call
<!--Page 334-->
her, Tudmur. Nor will it be difficult to revive
her. A large tract can be placed under cultivation,
where there shall be protection for life and property;
old wells exist in the ruins; foresting the highlands
to the north and west will cause rain; and the aqueducts
in the old days may easily be repaired.</p>

<p>I am unwilling to indulge in a description of the
modern ruin of the great old depôt, which has employed
so many pens. But very little has been said concerning
the old tomb-towers, which have taken at Palmyra
the place of Egyptian pyramids. Here, as elsewhere
in ancient Syria, sepulture was extramural, and every
settlement was approached by one or more Viâ Appia,
much resembling that of ancient Rome. At Palmyra
there are, or, rather, were, notably two: one (south-west)
upon the high road to Damascus; the other,
north-west of the official or monumental city, formed,
doubtless, the main approach from Hauran and
Hamah. The two are lined on both sides with
those interesting monuments, whose squat, solid
forms of gloomy and unsquared sandstone contrast
remarkably with the bastard classical and Roman
architecture, meretricious in all its details, and glittering
from afar in white limestone. Inscriptions in the
Palmyrian character prove that they date from about
<span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 2 and 102; but they have evidently been
restored, and this perhaps fixes the latest restoration.
It is highly probable that the heathen method of
burial declined under the Roman rule, especially
after <span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 130, when the Great Half-way House
<!--Page 335-->
again changed its name to Adrianopolis. Still,
vestiges of the old custom are found in the Hauran
and in the Druze Mountain west of the great valley,
extending deep into the second century, when, it is
believed, Gassanides of Damascus had abandoned
their heathen faith for Christianity. I found in the
tombs, or cells, fragments of mummies, and these,
it is suspected, were the first ever brought to England.
Almost all the skulls contained date-stones, more or
less, and a peach stone and an apricot stone were
found under similar circumstances. At Shathah we
picked up in the mummy-towers almond shells with
the sharp ends cut off and forming baby cups.</p>

<p>There are three tomb-towers at Palmyra still
standing, and perhaps likely to yield good results.
The people call them Kasr el Zaynah (Pretty Palace),
Kasr el Azin (Palace of the Maiden), and Kasr el
Arus (Palace of the Bride). They number four
and five stories, but the staircases, which run up
the thickness of the walls, are broken, and so are
the monolithic slabs which form the lower floors.
Explorers, therefore, must take with them ropes and
hooks, ladders which will reach to eighty feet, planks
to act as bridges, and a short crowbar. We had none
of these requirements, nor could the wretched village
provide them. I have little doubt that the upper
stories would be found to contain bones, coins, and
pottery, perhaps entire mummies.</p>

<p>The shortness of our visit allowed me only a day
and a half to try the fortune of excavation at Palmyra.
<!--Page 336-->
It was easy to hire a considerable number of labourers
at two and a half piastres a head per diem&mdash;&#8203;say 6<span class="price"><abbr title="denarii">d.</abbr></span>&mdash;&#8203;when
in other places the wages would be at least double.
Operations began (April 15th) at the group of
tomb-towers bearing west-south-west from the great
Temple of the Sun: I chose this group because it
appeared the oldest of the series. The fellahs, or
peasants, know it as Kusin Ahi Sayl (Palaces of
the Father of a Torrent); and they stare when told
that these massive buildings are not royal residences
but tombs. Here the tombs in the several stages were
easily cleared out by my forty-five coolies, who had
nothing but diminutive picks and bars, grain-lugs and
body-cloths, which they converted into buckets for
removing sand and rubbish. But these cells and those
of the adjoining ruins had before been ransacked, and
they supplied nothing beyond skulls, bones, and
shreds of mummy cloth, whose dyes were remarkably
brilliant.</p>

<p>The hands were then applied to an adjoining mound:
it offered a tempting resemblance to the undulations
of ground which cover the complicated chambered
catacombs already laid open, and into one of which,
some years ago, a camel fell, the roof having given
way. After reaching a stratum of snow-white gypsum,
which appeared to be artificial, though all hands agreed
that it was not, we gave up the task, as time pressed
so hard. The third attempt laid open the foundation
of a house, and showed us the well, or rain-cistern,
shaped, as such reservoirs are still in the Holy Land,
<!--Page 337-->
like a soda-water bottle. The fourth trial was more
successful; during our absence the workmen came
upon two oval slabs of soft limestone, each with its kit-cat
in high relief. One was a man with straight
features, short, curly beard, and hair disposed, as
appears to have been the fashion for both sexes, in
three circular rolls. The other was a feminine bust,
with features of a type so exaggerated as to resemble
the negro. A third and similar work of art was
brought up, but the head had been removed. It would
be hard to explain the excitement caused by these
wonderful discoveries; report flew abroad that gold
images of life-size had been dug up, and the least
disposed to exaggeration declared that chests full of
gold coins and ingots had fallen to our lot.</p>

<p>On the next morning we left Palmyra, and, after
a hard gallop which lasted for the best part of four
days, we found ourselves, not much the worse for
wear, once more at Damascus.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_8"><span class="muchsmaller">[8]</span></a> Burton writes of Syria in 1870. The journey from Beyrut to
Damascus has now been made easy by the opening of the railway.
The line rises some four thousand feet, crosses two ranges of mountains
on the Lebanon, and passes through some beautiful scenery. After
traversing the Plain of Bakaa through the Anti-Lebanon, the railway
enters the Yahfâfeh, continuing to Sûk Wady Barada, the ancient
Abila, where is seen the rock-cut aqueducts made by Zenobia to

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
